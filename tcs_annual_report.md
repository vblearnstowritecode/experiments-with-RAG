Remembering Mr. T ata
Padma Vibhushan
Ratan N Tata
28 December 1937 – 9 October 2024
It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell 
to Mr . Ratan Naval Tata, a truly uncommon leader 
whose immeasurable contributions have shaped 
not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our 
nation.

expanded its global footprint while always remaining 
true to its moral compass.
Mr . Tata’s dedication to philanthropy and the 
development of society has touched the lives of 
millions. From education to healthcare, his initiatives 
have left a deep-rooted mark that will benefit 
generations to come. Reinforcing all of this work 
was Mr . Tata's genuine humility in every individual 
interaction. 
His legacy will continue to inspire us 
as we strive to uphold the principles 
he so passionately championed.

Letter from the
Chairman
Dear Shareholders,
The financial year 2025 was a year of profound global disruption. 
Widespread geopolitical conflicts, military escalations, and 
uncertain trade dynamics severely impacted global supply 
chains. Over 60 nations went to the polls, stalling policy 
continuity and reform agendas across several key markets. 
As a result, businesses worldwide faced significant shocks—
ranging from falling production volumes and rising costs to 
suboptimal asset utilization, impacting profitability and cash 
flows.
In the face of this turbulence, your company demonstrated 
exceptional resilience. We partnered closely with our clients 
to help them perform under pressure while accelerating 
their transformation agendas. By harnessing the power of 
The single most transformative force in 2024 
was Generative AI. GenAI is not just another 
tech cycle—it is a civilizational shift. I believe 
every industry stands to benefit from GenAI.
 
TCS is proactively leading this change. We have 
systematically infused AI across our offerings 
and built intelligent agent solutions throughout 
the value chain. Looking ahead, we will deliver 
solutions through a human+AI model, invest 
in AI infrastructure and forge industry-best 
partnerships.
Generative AI and other emerging technologies, we 
enabled our clients to prepare for the future. The range 
of transformation is multifaceted and truly profound. 
For example, we worked with a client to develop a GenAI–based 
drug discovery solution that created over 1,300 molecules for 
a concept target, then assessed synthesizability and shortlisted 
12 molecules undergoing in-vitro testing. For another client, 
we implemented a direct-to-consumer digital solution for the 
automotive industry, allowing a seamless omnichannel presence 
and customized vehicle ownership experience. In another case, 
we modernized 50 million lines of legacy code into a modern 
AI-powered architecture.

Warm regards,
N Chandrasekaran
Chairman
These efforts, alongside many others, contributed to a robust 
financial performance, with FY 2025 revenue of US $30 billion 
and an industry-leading operating margin of 24.3%. Your 
company was once again recognized as a Global Top Employer 
for the tenth successive year . 
The evolving geopolitical landscape and the emergence of a 
multipolar world are now reshaping how global businesses 
operate. We are witnessing the rise of new paradigms, 
demanding a thorough reimagination of systems, processes, 
and technologies to improve visibility, reduce costs, and enhance 
operational throughput. This reimagination includes designing 
end-to-end traceability across supply chains; diversification 
of sourcing strategies to build resilience, and region-specific 
ecosystems to serve decentralized markets.
Simultaneously, we are in the midst of an irreversible 
transition towards green energy. While jurisdictions vary in 
pace and regulation, businesses must adapt by developing 
market-appropriate solutions. Nowhere is this more evident 
than in the automotive sector. Investments in wind, solar, and 
small modular reactors (SMRs) are surging, leading to the 
development of new factories, supply chains, and digital tools 
that optimize both generation and consumption of energy. 
Your company has developed an AI-powered clever energy 
platform that has been helping clients optimize energy 
consumption, reducing emissions and energy costs.
Yet, the single most transformative force in 2024 was 
Generative AI. Achieving near-human reasoning capabilities, 
GenAI is not just another tech cycle, it is a civilizational shift. 
Its widespread adoption is accelerating, powered by parallel 
advances in semiconductors, cloud computing, quantum 
technologies, robotics, and energy innovation. GenAI is already 
redefining analytics, customer experience, and marketing. 
The rise of autonomous robots and AI agents promises a future 
of ‘dark factories’ and AI-assisted enterprise functions.
I believe every industry stands to benefit from GenAI—and 
the IT industry is no exception. TCS is uniquely positioned to 
lead this transition. With our domain expertise, deep client 
relationships, and contextual knowledge, we are the ideal 
partner for enterprises seeking to build AI-first cultures, 
transform supply chains, navigate energy transitions, and build 
resilient and adaptive operations.
However, to lead in this new world, we too must continuously 
evolve. The path is clear: IT and business services are moving 
toward autonomous operations. Software development is being 
redefined by AI-led modernization, as legacy code is being 
transformed rapidly. Finally, agentic AI is being embedded deeply 
into enterprise systems.
TCS is proactively leading this change. We have systematically 
infused AI across our offerings and built intelligent agent 
solutions throughout the value chain. In 2025, we will have the 
largest AI-trained workforce in the industry and have launched 
our enterprise-grade GenAI platform: TCS WisdomNextTM.
Looking ahead, we plan four distinct progressions. First, we 
establish a large pool of AI agents working alongside our human 
workforce. Second, we deliver solutions through a human+AI 
model. Third, we will consciously invest in AI data centers and 
cloud infrastructure. Fourth, we forge industry-best partnerships 
with hardware providers, solution innovators, and startups.
This integrated approach will help us bring the best capabilities 
to every customer, ensuring they are future-ready, resilient, and 
competitive. We remain steadfastly committed to leading the 
industry with purpose, innovation, and responsibility. 
Thank you for your continued trust and support as we shape the 
future, together .

Letter from 
the CEO

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to share that in FY 2025, we achieved two 
extraordinary milestones crossing the US$30 billion mark 
in revenues and the US$20 billion mark in brand value. This 
success is a testament to the early investments we have made in 
strengthening client relationships, building intellectual property, 
deepening employee capabilities and expanding technology 
ecosystem. I am grateful to every stakeholder for contributing to 
our growth and success.  
In a very challenging geopolitical and macro-economic 
environment, the company reported an annual revenue of 
₹255,324 crore in FY 2025, growing 6.0% year-on-year (4.2% in 
constant currency). Growth Markets experienced strong demand 
across key industries, fueled by accelerated digital adoption and 
new client acquisitions. Governments invested 
significantly in digital public services, creating 
opportunities for  TCS to drive large-scale transformation. 
Our disciplined execution and operational rigor stood out again, 
as we delivered industry-leading margins of 24.3%, even as we 
accelerated investments in talent and expanded capabilities. Our 
net margin was at 19.0%. Earnings per share were at ₹134.19, a 
growth of 5.1%2 over the prior year .  
Our customer-centric focus and commitment to long-term value 
creation is well recognized by our clients. We were ranked #1 for 
customer satisfaction in Europe for the 12th year in a row. The 
number of clients spending over US$100 Mn annually, increased 
to 64 in FY 2025. 
Significant innovation is happening in the AI 
ecosystem across infrastructure, data platforms, 
models and AI native business applications. These 
innovations are forcing companies to invest in 
technology modernization and rapidly adopt AI to 
meet evolving customer expectations.  
Our focus on innovation and growth drives us 
to continuously explore new technologies and 
business models, ensuring we stay ahead in an 
ever-evolving landscape.

Best regards,
K Krithivasan
Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director
The core values of Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for 
Individual, Excellence and Learning & Sharing strongly bind 
and unify our 607,979 associates globally. TCS continues to 
strengthen its brand and has received over 100 awards for its 
HR practices. Our AI-First approach significantly advanced talent 
management, learning, and employee engagement. This has 
led to industry leading retention rates with LTM attrition in IT 
services at 13.3%. 
Our capital allocation policy of returning substantial free 
cashflow to shareholders has been very consistent. The Board 
has recommended a final dividend of ₹30 per share, bringing the 
total dividend for the year to ₹126 per share. For the full year, 
the company’s shareholder payout was ₹45,588 crore, with a 
payout ratio of 94%.  
We reported a robust Total Contract Value (TCV) of 
US$ 39.4 billion. This TCV included a balanced mix of large, 
medium and small deals, which augurs well for the future. We 
saw TCV improvement across markets as clients prioritized 
initiatives around technology modernization, cost optimization, 
vendor consolidation, operating model transformation, and risk 
and compliance. We remain closely connected to our customers 
to help them navigate the challenges impacting their business. 
For example, we were selected by Primark, a leading 
international fashion retailer across 17 countries in Europe and 
the US, to transform their technology operations to support the 
retailer’s ambitious plans for global growth over the next five 
years.  
We are also partnering with Xerox in its re-invention strategy, 
accelerating its transition to a streamlined, services-led, and 
software-enabled organization. TCS will consolidate Xerox’s 
technology services to enhance business outcomes, migrate 
complex legacy data centers to the Azure public cloud, 
implement a cloud-based Digital ERP platform to revolutionize 
business processes, and integrate GenAI into operations to 
foster sustainable growth. 
Significant innovation is happening in the AI ecosystem across 
infrastructure, data platforms, models and AI native business 
applications. These innovations are forcing companies to invest 
in technology modernization and rapidly adopt AI to meet 
evolving customer expectations.  
Across industries, clients are increasingly shifting their focus 
from use case based approach to ROI led scaling of AI. We 
support them by:
• Establishing AI Centers of Excellence for scalable Enterprise 
AI strategies 
• Creating AI Labs for technology experimentation with 
clients 
• Building safe, secure, scalable GenAI as a Service Platforms
• Providing domain AI solutions for business operations with 
over 150 AI agents  
• Delivering GenAI-infused services for Software Engineering, 
IT operations, Technology Modernization, and Cyber 
Security 
• Setting up sovereign secure Cloud with integrated AI 
Given the industry shifts led by AI and the opportunity to 
drive significant long-term growth, we have announced two 
key organizational changes effective 1st May 2025. Aarthi 
Subramanian has joined as President and Chief Operating 
Officer, working closely with me to help chart the future of our 
company. We are also pleased to welcome Mangesh Sathe as 
our new Chief Strategy Officer . Both Aarthi and Mangesh are 
seasoned, respected leaders whose expertise and vision will 
play a pivotal role in strengthening our growth journey, refining 
our organizational structure, and enhancing our operational 
excellence. 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to delivering value to 
all stakeholders and setting new benchmarks in the IT services 
industry. Our focus on innovation and growth drives us to 
continuously explore new technologies and business models, 
ensuring we stay ahead in an ever-evolving landscape. 
We thank you for your continued support and trust in our 
journey.

marginal decline of 30 basis points compared to FY 2024.

For the Election Commission of India – the nation’s poll 
conducting body – elections start with the preparation of 
electoral rolls. 
Electoral rolls are the backbone of the election process. They 
are comprehensive lists maintained with stringent guidelines 
to ensure up-to-date information of electors. The Elector 
registration and form processing has been the core work of 
election officials across the nation for maximizing the citizen 
participation in the elections.  Preparing electoral rolls is a 
meticulous process that involves identifying eligible electors, 
collecting data, verifying and making necessary corrections, 
and continuously updating the roll—and this must be done for 
hundreds of thousands of citizens, spread across remote villages, 
dense urban centers, and everything in between.       
The election body collaborated with TCS and developed a 
flagship web-based application ERO Net 2.0, that revolutionized 
electoral roll management in India. The application managed 
end-to-end life cycle of electors, and was available nationwide.
ERO Net 2.0 application has a centralized database that serves 
as the single source of truth for the election body. A standout 
feature is the executive dashboard, which is updated daily and 
offers a 360-degree view of the life cycle of electors.
Customer Stories
The application is pivotal for providing electoral 
information quickly to citizens. Electors can update and 
search their details using their Electoral Photo Identity 
Card (EPIC) or personal information. In addition, the voter 
information slip is generated from the application and 
handed to the electors by booth-level officers, providing 
all the necessary details about the elector and their 
polling station.  TCS developed printing tool, has reduced 
the time to distribute electoral rolls and enhanced 
security of the electoral rolls data.
The ERO Net 2.0 Suit of applications includes BLO mobile 
application which plays a critical role for all elections in 
the country. The application has been used to print over 
25 crore EPICs and nearly 125 Crore voter information 
slips. Over 78 crore electors have been verified through 
house-to-house surveys. The application is making voting 
more accessible, more secure, and more inclusive for 
everyone.
As the primary technology partner, TCS helped the 
election body give a digital makeover to electoral roll 
management. The application that TCS developed was 
rolled-out nationwide within 7 months of launch, with 
complete functionalities and data migration. It allows 
over 1.05 million nationwide officials to handle elector 
registrations, updates, and deletions efficiently.

For over a decade, TCS has been a strategic partner to 
CFS, supporting numerous initiatives. To aid CFS in this 
transformative journey, TCS leveraged its innovation 
ecosystem, partnerships, thought leadership and proprietary 
solutions to craft a comprehensive transition roadmap. 
With expertise from its AI.Cloud business unit, TCS built an 
enterprise-wide AWS Cloud Foundation from the ground-up 
to host all FirstChoice applications, enabling enhanced digital 
experiences for its members. TCS also reimagined CFS’s 
Customer Correspondence Management and Document

A journey towards 
becoming the most 
trusted advisor
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), the nation’s largest 
bank, announced the separation of its wealth business, selling 
off its majority stake to a private equity firm, Kohlberg, Kravis 
and Roberts (KKR). This marked the beginning of a new era for 
Colonial First State (CFS), which emerged as a fully independent 
entity. 
CFS had to transition its entire IT estate, including the 
member-facing FirstChoice platform, to a CFS-controlled 
environment within an ambitious timeline. Compounding the 
complexity, many critical applications were owned by CBA, 
requiring CFS to build systems from scratch. Additionally, 
seamless management of over 30 vendors was essential to 
ensure uninterrupted service delivery and uphold the trust 
built over 30 years. To meet the evolving needs of its almost 
1 million customers and advisors, CFS prioritized building a 
digital-powered, cloud-ready enterprise.

A global transportation and logistics leader, serving customers 
in over 200 countries with services like express delivery, freight 
forwarding, and logistics solutions, has been facing increasing 
issues with porch piracy and fraud, leading to customer 
dissatisfaction. In 2023, the Chamber of Commerce reported 
approximately 44 million packages lost or stolen, amounting to 
US$5 billion worth of goods lost. 
The logistics provider sought a solution to assess risks and 
enhance the security of parcel delivery. It leveraged its

smarter, safer shipping decisions even before labels are 
printed. Additionally, it opened up a new revenue stream 
for the logistics provider . The solution has a potential to 
save US$ 500 million annually in the industry.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-2579
Management 
Discussion and 
Analysis
Overview of the Industry
The year 2024 began with signs of improved economic activity 
across major regions. The world GDP grew at a steady rate of 
3.3%1. Despite divergent growth patterns across regions and 
sectors, the global technology landscape demonstrated 
unexpected stability. 
However, in recent weeks, the global outlook has 
turned negative, as governments worldwide adjust 
their policy priorities, leading to unprecedented 
levels of uncertainty. The rapid escalation of trade 
tensions and extremely high policy uncertainty are 
anticipated to significantly impact global economic 
activity. Projections indicate that global growth will 
decline to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 20261. Amid these 
ongoing macroeconomic challenges, new discretionary 
projects requiring technology investments will face increased 
scrutiny and require stronger justifications for return on 
investment.
In 2025, enterprises will be accelerating adoption of AI into 
their digital core, to address technical debt and modernize 
legacy systems. This will require efforts in cloud migration, 
updating infrastructure frameworks and developing a strong data 
foundation. Enterprises also face a complex risk landscape with 
cybersecurity threats and geopolitical tensions, making them 
prime targets for cybercriminals due to their valuable intellectual 
property and customer data. Enterprises will continue to 
strengthen their cybersecurity management processes, leading to 
continued investments in security consulting services2.

Research and Innovation
TCS Research and Innovation has been investing into two types of 
initiatives: 
• Future of Technology Initiatives, aimed at tracking and 
developing novel technologies and platforms to accelerate 
technology adoption. They cover several core IT areas, 
including sensing, communication, computing, data 
and knowledge engineering, digital and physical AI, and 
experiential technologies.
• Future of Work Initiatives, aimed at infusing emerging 
technologies to create new practices for work, focusing on 
various IT , business, and societal work domains.
Anticipating the rise of quantum sensing, TCS entered a 
partnership with IIT Bombay to develop India’s first Quantum 
Diamond Microchip Imager, set to revolutionize semiconductor 
manufacturing. TCS helps clients tackle complex problems with 
quantum tech and prepare for challenges like quantum-safe 
cryptography.
More details on TCS R&I investments during the year are available 
on Page 73 of Board‘s Report in the section on ‘Technology 
absorption, adoption and innovation’.
Artificial Intelligence and Cloud
TCS is investing extensively in AI to redefine many knowledge 
work domains, such as software engineering, technology 
modernization, marketing, energy management, drug discovery, 
accelerated diagnosis and personalized cure, among others. 
For physical work domains, such as logistics and warehouse 
management, TCS is developing versatile, intelligent robots and 
platforms to orchestrate an ensemble of robots and people. 
As AI crosses the enterprise adoption chasm, TCS expects data, 
models, and agents to become increasingly industry or function-
specific. To support this, TCS is making focused investments in 
several areas:  
• AI-first Software Development, Maintenance and 
Operations: A differentiated TCS PoV on enterprise-grade 
AI-infused SDLC, IT & Business Process Operations, integrated 
with responsible AI tooling and TCS & partner IP .
• AI-native Application Modernization: Combining deep 
TCS contextual knowledge of legacy application estates and 
pairing GenAI with TCS MasterCraft™, TCS Crystallus™ and 
agentic modernization capability in WisdomNextTM to help 
customers transform their technology estate with AI.
• AI Reimagined Value Chains powered by Data, Models and 
Agents: Numerous packaged use-cases and autonomous 
agents are already catalogued in TCS’ AI platform, 
WisdomNextTM.
• Partner-led AI Co-innovation: TCS has set up dedicated  
geo-spread partner teams to deepen co-innovation with 
major hyperscalers and other important ecosystem players.
• Strategic Advisory: TCS’ AI Advisory and Consulting capability 
blends strategy and scaled execution to help CXOs navigate 
technology fit, value realization, talent impact and emerging 
regulation (for example, the EU AI Act).
In recent years, market adoption of Cloud has matured to hybrid 
multi-cloud configurations, requiring seamless integration with 
private/on-premise systems, future cloud native architectures, AI 
thought leadership and synergies across many services to deliver 
the outcomes for the customers. To capitalize on this growth 
potential in overall Cloud space, TCS has formed full-stack teams 
in offerings, engineering, sales, solutions, and platform-based 
operations. 
TCS is also doubling down on its world-class advisory team within 
the central cloud unit to help customers navigate the complexity 
and cost dynamics of the ever-changing cloud environment.
To bolster cloud partnerships across hyperscalers and other major 
cloud players, TCS has established a well-networked geo-spread 
alliance team to closely nurture partner relationships, foster co-
engineering, and develop joint go-to-market strategies with an 
aim to hold the elite partner positions.
TCS continues to invest in training, certifications, credentials and 
in building solutions and intellectual property around hybrid 
multi-cloud services. The Company has also invested in content 
partnerships and GenAI playgrounds to enable AI literacy and 
deep skilling of employees.
In view of the increasing number of large enterprise data 
transformation programs, TCS is strengthening teams across areas 
such as streaming data, observability, MLOps, and compliance

Scaling Presence in Growth Markets
Growth markets are characterized by rapidly evolving regulatory 
landscapes, a burgeoning digital economy, and a pace of 
technology adoption that often surpasses that of mature 
markets. TCS stands out in these markets due to its early 
investments and strong board & C-level relationships, enabling 
strategic customer engagement, anticipation of industry shifts, 
and large-scale digital transformation. TCS’ capability in delivering 
large system integration and transformational projects of national 
importance in India like BSNL, Passport Seva, Election Commission 
etc. further differentiates the Company. 
Growth Markets require agile, cost-effective solutions, tailored 
for first-time digital adopters. TCS’ strategy in these markets 
is anchored in four key pillars: deepening client relationships, 
expanding the services portfolio to include new-generation 
services, leveraging TCS IPs and partnerships, and investing in 
areas such as energy transition, smart cities, and public services. 
The Company’s unique differentiation lies in its deep client 
connections, contextual knowledge, domain expertise, and ability 
to co-innovate with customers through dedicated innovation hubs 
and research partnerships like TCS GoZero Hub. 
Navigating macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts is integral to 
TCS’ Growth Markets strategy. The Company’s localized presence, 
strong client relationships, and diversified industry exposure 
allow it to mitigate risks while capturing new opportunities. 
This strategic diversity enhances resilience, ensuring that the 
Company continues to deliver value to its clients, even amid global 
uncertainties.
Branding
TCS continues to strengthen its brand through strategic 
investments and global partnerships, anchored by its enduring 
promise, ‘With you for the long run’. To compliment this, 
the Company recently introduced the ‘Perpetually Adaptive 
Enterprise’ narrative, highlighting its long-term vision and 
commitment to helping clients stay resilient, agile and adaptive in 
a constantly evolving world. 
TCS significantly expanded its brand presence through its premier 
sports sponsorship portfolio. Last year, TCS partnered with the 
Sydney Marathon, the first city in the Southern Hemisphere to 
join the majors circuit and became the official AI and technology 
partner of the Schneider Electric Marathon de Paris. With 14 
major running events worldwide, TCS’ running sponsorships 
collectively generated US$2.25 billion in economic impact for 
host cities and helped raise over US$279 million for charities. 
TCS is also the principal partner of Jaguar TCS Racing, leveraging 
advanced technology to promote sustainable innovation and 
help accelerate the electrification journey in motorsport. In 2024, 
Jaguar TCS Racing won the ABB FIA Formula E Teams’ World 
Championship.
These high-impact partnerships boost TCS’ global visibility and 
reinforce the Company’s commitment to endurance, progress and 
shared purpose. In recognition of its sustained investment, TCS 
was named among the Top 50 global brands across all industries 
in 2024 by Kantar BrandZ, retained its position as India’s #1 brand, 
and was valued by Brand Finance at US$21.3 billion, making it the 
second most valuable brand in the global IT services sector. TCS’s 
brand awareness among business executives has reached 95%, 
reflecting the continued growth and recognition as a global brand.

Analysis of revenue growth and margin performance
On a reported basis, TCS’ revenue grew 6.0% in FY 2025, compared to 6.8% in the previous year . Despite increased macroeconomic 
uncertainty, the Company closed the year with a strong and resilient order book. During the year, clients prioritized initiatives around 
Technology modernization, Cost optimization, Vendor consolidation, Operating model transformation, Risk and Compliance. Ongoing 
delays and deferrals led to muted revenue growth in FY 2025.
EBIT margins were 24.3% in FY 2025, compared to 24.6%6 in the previous year . The 30-basis point decline was influenced by headwinds 
from merit-based interventions, including annual hikes, promotions, and investments in infrastructure and capability building. However, 
tailwinds such as improved utilization, productivity, and realization, along with favorable currency movements, contributed positively to 
the margins. 
Average currency exchange rates during FY 2025 for the three major currencies are given below:
Currency Weightage (%) FY 2025 (₹) FY 2024 (₹) % Change YoY

GBP 14.7 108.26 104.07 4.0
EUR 10.9 90.81 89.80 1.1
Movements in currency exchange rates through the year resulted in a positive impact of 1.8% on the reported revenue. The constant 
currency revenue growth for the year, which is the reported revenue growth stripped of the currency impact, was 4.2%.

Business Outlook
Global growth is projected to be 2.8% in 2025 and 3.0% in 20267, significantly below the 3.7% average growth rate seen from 2000 to 
2019. While global economic activity faces headwinds from geopolitical and policy uncertainties, there are opportunities for resilience and 
recovery. Clearer trade agreements and improved global cooperation could help regain momentum. However, risks like financial market 
volatility, demographic shifts, and fiscal constraints persist. Proactive policy responses and innovation-driven growth can help mitigate 
these pressures.
In this challenging environment, enterprises are expected to go through longer decision cycles and experience increased scrutiny 
on discretionary spending. Staying close to changing customer needs is essential to understanding both direct and indirect impacts. 
Businesses must embrace continuous transformation to stay resilient and shifting market dynamics call for the ability to anticipate change, 
adapt rapidly, and turn potential disruptions into strategic advantages.

Enterprise Risk Management
TCS understands the importance of effectively managing and mitigating risks to protect the Company’s business and its clients and to 
add value for all its stakeholders. Based on the Risk Management Policy approved by the Board, the Company follows a comprehensive 
enterprise risk management framework (based on best practices from COSO 2017 and ISO 31000:2018) that encompasses risk 
identification, risk assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk governance. TCS fosters a risk-aware 
culture, empowering leaders to take intelligent risks to maximize value. Regular risk reviews, assessments, and scenario planning help 
anticipate challenges and develop mitigation plans. Key risk indicators and control indicators are used to assess risks, provide early 
warnings, and consider effectiveness of the mitigation actions, respectively. TCS engages with all stakeholders, including customers, 
employees, suppliers, partners and regulatory authorities, to ensure transparent and collaborative risk management practices. The focus 
remains on driving sustainable growth, fostering innovation, delivering value to its clients, employees, and shareholders, being resilient 
and enhancing its reputation.

Impact On HC IC
Financial implications of R/O  –
Risk:
The volatility of geo-political events and macroeconomic 
changes, like wars, adverse trade policies and continuing high 
inflation in major economies can impact client spending and 
also squeeze liquidity. TCS’ clients’ business outlook could 
be affected and in turn result in demand uncertainty for TCS’ 
services, and an increase in TCS’ cost of doing business. Risks 
to service delivery, business continuity, cybersecurity, sanctions 
compliance and human rights in geo-politically sensitive zones 
may increase costs and impact revenue growth.
Mitigation:
Broad-based business mix with diversified focus across 
geographies and industry verticals and targeting CXO business 
in addition to CIOs aid in balancing the risk impact.  Active 
monitoring of the changing geo-political landscape, ensuring 
business continuity plans and strengthening internal controls 
against secondary risks continue. 
Risk:
In a knowledge industry, growth is dependent on the ability 
to attract, develop, inspire, and retain talent. New emerging 
technology areas also require niche skill sets, and talent scarcity 
in the industry may result in attrition in these areas.
Mitigation:
Huge investments in talent development with the focus of  
re-skilling programs to adapt to new and emerging technologies 
have been made and which will continue at a rapid pace. 
Expanding business delivery centres to tier-2/tier-3 cities in India 
to enable leveraging local talent supply and diversification also 
aids in addressing the talent risk. Investments are also made 
in branding, STEM/goIT programs and campus engagements in 
global markets, to improve local hiring and retention.

Risk:
The global delivery model requires the mobility of the 
Company’s skilled professionals across the globe, and any 
regulatory restrictions in key markets can pose a threat. This 
may also have an impact on the cost of doing business and 
client project delays.
Mitigation:
Promoting usage of Location Independent AgileTM model with 
increased collaboration, material reduction in dependency 
on work visas through increased hiring of local talent and 
promoting local talent building in STEM areas helps to minimize 
this risk.
Risk:
With new consumer patterns/behaviour unfolding, industries 
are evolving their business models. Some customers and 
segments may see restructuring initiatives, to adapt to newer 
markets, competition, mergers/acquisition, regulatory drivers 
and enhance efficiencies to create new business opportunities. 
This may result in an impact on the current services being 
provided.
Mitigation:
Scanning future industry outlook for both business & technology 
for trends, capabilities & solutions, and providing pro-active, 
agile responses to drive transformation for the customer using 
differentiated offerings. 
Opportunity:
Technology enabled business model innovation for clients, 
driving value for clients in their business transformation journey.

Financial implications of R/O + –
Risk:
Volatility in TCS’ functional currency (INR) against major 
currencies may cause fluctuation in the reported revenue, 
profitability/margins, which may impact stakeholder 
perceptions of the underlying business momentum and 
profitability.
Mitigation:
To limit the impact of short-term exchange volatility, the 
currency hedging policy aligned with best practices is in 
place. Hedging strategies are guided and monitored by the 
Risk Management Committee of the Board. Management 
commentary is based on constant currency for better 
stakeholder understanding of business performance.
Risk:
TCS’ global nature of operations requires it to be compliant 
with various privacy legislations like GDPR, DPDPA etc. carrying 
severe consequences for violations and data breaches. Privacy 
risks have increased with AI adoption getting democratized with 
the latest tools. Any violations or data breaches can have an 
impact on the Company’s business operations and its brand with 
material liabilities.
Mitigation:
The global privacy policy supported by the Privacy governance 
framework PriVACE, organization structure with a Global Privacy 
Office and Geography level DPOs, embedding ‘Privacy by design’ 
in TCS’ solution/service delivery, risk based due diligence on 
third parties, data protection controls and audits across all its 
areas of operation ensure the risk is minimized. 
Keeping up to date with regulatory changes, training and 
awareness for all stakeholders and strong governance at regional 
and enterprise level has continuous focus.
Opportunity:
Enterprises, increasing their investments in enhancing Data 
Privacy, opens a fast-growing business opportunity for TCS.

Risks of cyber-attacks are on a constant rise and evolving 
quickly with far-reaching consequences. Attacks may emerge 
due to geo-political events, pandemic themed cyber threats 
etc. Security breaches could result in reputational damage, 
penalties, and legal and financial liabilities along with impact on 
business operations.
Mitigation:
Investments in state-of-the-art security operations centre with 
automated playbooks; continued reinforcement of stringent 
security policies, procedures and controls (ISO 27001 certified), 
enterprise-wide training/awareness programs and communication 
with internal and external audits. Use of advanced AI/ML based 
tools to detect and prevent incursions with advanced quarantine 
capabilities, including perimeter security controls with enhanced 
internal vulnerability detection, data leak prevention tools, incident 
management and recovery process, red/purple teaming, “breach 
and attack” simulations in compliance with industry best practices 
are implemented. Close collaboration with Computer Emergency 
Response Team (CERT) and other private cyber intelligence 
agencies help to stay ahead of the curve.
Opportunity:
It is imperative for all enterprises to create robust and proactive 
cyber resilience strategies to address increasing threats. 
This presents opportunities for TCS to modernize security 
operations, transform and uplift cyber defense & cyber offense, 
invest in GenAI and Cloud security offerings and de-risk future 
quantum computer-based attacks for its customers.
Risk:
TCS’ global nature of operations requires it to comply with 
ever-evolving, complex regulatory requirements across multiple 
jurisdictions & compliance areas. Failure to comply can result in 
penalties, reputational damage, and criminal prosecution.
Mitigation:
A centralised program for horizon scanning of all regulatory 
changes, combined with an enterprise-wide regulatory 
compliance framework for adoption into policies, processes 
and controls ensure compliance with all regulatory obligations. 
Continued focus on fostering an ethical and compliance culture, 
with governance at board, executive and management levels 
through quarterly declarations, risk assessments and audits 
enable the Company to stay compliant in an ever-changing 
environment.
Opportunity:
Enterprises need to invest in compliance programs to keep 
up with evolving regulations in their sector or geography. TCS 
provides Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) services and 
offerings to enterprises in various industry compliance domains, 
especially regulated industries.

Risk:
Risk of infringement of IP of customers, suppliers, partners and 
alliance organizations by TCS associates may lead to potential 
liabilities, increased litigation and reputation impact.
Also, inadequate protection of TCS’ IP may lead to potential loss 
of ownership rights, revenue and value. 
Mitigation:
An industry leading IP Management Framework with processes, 
contractual and operational controls and tools to prevent 
and detect risks of IP infringement has been established, 
with a well-defined (software) asset lifecycle governance 
framework ensuring that TCS products are safe to create, safe 
to protect and safe to use. Employee level key controls include 
employee confidentiality agreement, training and awareness 
for IP protection and prevention of IP contamination and 
infringement. 
Risk:
Litigation risks might arise from commercial disputes, alleged 
violation of IPR, personal data/information breach incidents/
claims   and employment related matters. The Company’s rising 
profile and scale also makes it an attractive target for meritless 
lawsuits. These lead to reputation risk, legal expenses and 
adverse rulings can result in substantive damage.
Mitigation:
Strong processes, controls and governance for compliance 
to contractual obligations, information security, IP policy and 
immigration. Strengthened the team of in-house counsels in all 
major geographies and a network of reputed global law firms

Internal Financial Control Systems and their Adequacy
TCS has aligned its systems of internal financial control in line 
with the globally accepted risk-based framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway 
Commission. This framework of internal financial controls meets 
the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013. The Internal Control 
– Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to 
increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s 
process of designing and implementing a system of internal 
control. The framework requires a company to identify and 
analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The Company 
has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its 
effectiveness. 
TCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size and the 
nature of its operations. These have been designed to provide 
reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing 
reliable financial and operational information, complying with 
applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized 
use, executing transactions with proper authorization and 
ensuring compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-
defined delegation of power with authority limits commensurate 
with the responsibilities for approving engagements with all 
stakeholders that commit organizational resources and results 
in creation of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure. 
TCS employs an advanced Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data 
for accounting, consolidation and management information 
purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes and 
controls with global best practices.
TCS management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting [as defined in Regulation 
17 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015] as of March 31, 
2025. 
B S R & Co. LLP , the statutory auditors of TCS, have audited the 
financial statements included in this Integrated Annual Report 
and have issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting (as defined in Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013).
TCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP to 
oversee and carry out an internal audit of its activities. Design 
and operating effectiveness of process controls on financial 
transactions is also audited by an independent in-house internal 
audit team. The audit is based on an internal audit plan, which 
is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors 
and approved by the Audit Committee. In line with international 
practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the 
review of internal controls and risks in the Company’s operations 
such as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement, 
employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including 
the subsidiaries and foreign branches.
TCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized third party 
consultants and professionals for business specific compliances 
such as quality management, service management, information 
security, etc. The Audit Committee reviews reports submitted 
by the management and audit reports submitted by internal 
auditors and statutory auditors. Suggestions for improvement 
are considered, and the Audit Committee follows corrective 
action. The Audit Committee also meets TCS’ statutory auditors 
to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy of internal 
control systems and keeps the Board of Directors informed of its 
major observations periodically.
Based on its evaluation [as defined in Section 177 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 18 of Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015], TCS’ Audit Committee noted 
that, as of March 31, 2025, the Company’s internal financial 
controls were adequate and operating effectively.

I. Company’s Philosophy on Corporate Governance
  Effective corporate governance practices constitute the 
cornerstone of enduring and successful businesses. The 
Company’s commitment  to corporate governance guides 
its business decisions while ensuring financial responsibility, 
ethical conduct, and fairness to all stakeholders including 
employees, customers, investors, regulators, suppliers and 
the society at large.
  Strong leadership and effective corporate governance 
practices have been integral to the Company, aligned with 
the Tata culture and ethos. The Company adheres to the 
Tata group philosophy of building sustainable, community-
focused businesses that demonstrate deep respect for 
the environment. As part of the Tata group, known for its 
commitment to sustainability, the Company has inherited 
a strong tradition of ethical and transparent governance, in 
accordance with the Tata Code of Conduct (“TCoC”).
 The Company has adopted the TCoC for its employees 
including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director 
and the Executive Directors. In addition, the Company has 
adopted a Code of Conduct for its non-executive directors 
which includes Code of Conduct for Independent Directors 
which aligns with the responsibilities outlined in the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
 The Company’s corporate governance framework is further 
supported by the Tata Business Excellence Model, the TCS 
Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading and the 
Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices (“Insider Trading 
Code”). Further, an Information Security Policy is also in 
place to ensure responsible use of IT resources.
 The Company fully complies with the corporate governance 
requirements stipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read 
with Schedule V and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of  
sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 46 of Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI Listing 
Regulations”), as applicable.
 The Board structure and the various committees that 
constitute the governance structure1 of the organization are 
covered in detail in this report.

 The various material aspects of corporate governance and TCS’ approach to them are discussed in the table below:
Material Topic TCS’ Approach
Board effectiveness, 
independence and 
protection of minority 
shareholders’ interests
Board effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to serve on the 
Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively serve the best interests 
of all stakeholders, maintain Board and management accountability and drive corporate ethics, values and 
sustainability. Profiles of Board of Directors are available at https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/leadership.
For greater diversity of opinions and perspectives within the Board, the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee2 has fostered diversity in terms of backgrounds, areas of expertise and:
• Gender: Two out of the eight Directors (25%) are women;
• Nationality: Four nationalities represented – Indian, American, Danish and British;
• Industry: Technology, Banking, Energy, Transportation, Academia and Investment Banking.
TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at  
https://on.tcs.com/ApptDirectors.
Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 Independent Directors out 
of 8 i.e., 62.5%. None of the Independent Directors is related to each other, or to the Non-Independent 
Directors. Average tenure of Independent Directors is 4 years.
Board effectiveness is further enhanced by ensuring that none of the Directors hold directorships in more 
than seven listed entities, and the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (“CEO & MD”) does not 
serve as an Independent Director in any listed company.
TCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC which 
emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further, a qualified, diverse and independent 
Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.
TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures and detailed 
commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and material developments. The 
Company provides a variety of channels including a structured global investor outreach program, through 
which minority shareholders can interact with the management or the Board.
Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office through a 
well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’ Relationship 
Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints. 
Avoidance of conflict of 
interest3
Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the CEO & MD.
TCoC5 for non-executive directors and for independent directors carries explicit clauses covering 
avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee, including the executive 
directors, from accepting any position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other 
organization without TCS’ prior approval. For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained 
from the Board.
Values, ethics and 
compliance6
Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has earned its 
reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. The Company’s core 
values are: Leading change; Integrity; Respect for Individual; Excellence; Learning and Sharing.
The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate citizenship. It sets 
out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and corruption, 
recognition of employees’ freedom of association and avoidance of conflicts of interest.
Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based annual 
refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent 
communications from the leadership reiterate the importance of the Company values and the TCoC.
Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions and through inclusion of specific 
clauses in proposals and contracts.

Material Topic TCS’ Approach
Employees also undergo web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical behaviour . 
They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company, which are investigated 
and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other stakeholders can also report any 
non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by senior executives directly to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these 
channels is communicated to employees as part of the mandatory training modules.
Compliance to laws of the countries in which the Company operates, as well as global legislation such 
as Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance 
procedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are 
evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations.
Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer and the 
Chief Human Resources Officer. The Audit Committee chaired by an Independent Director, also oversees 
compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and to the 
external regulations.
Tax Strategy7 TCS is committed to complying with statutory tax obligations in all jurisdictions in which it operates in a 
responsible manner, and believes in reporting to the respective tax authorities, the relevant information 
that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner .
TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose of 
gaining tax advantages. TCS’ tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where available, 
while achieving 100% compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of the tax laws and regulations in 
all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance reporting and 
monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards 
tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by itself or by its employees or vendors.
TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide. 
Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of 
transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.
Building sustainable 
and responsible supply 
chain
TCS requires its suppliers to sign the TCoC upon empanelment, that includes principles on protecting and 
safeguarding human rights, treating all persons with respect and dignity while safeguarding their rights, 
the abolition of forced and compulsory labour, child labour in the supply chain and strong corporate 
governance practices including anti-corruption and bribery and promoting fair business practices across 
the supply chain. TCoC also requires its suppliers to protect the environment and make conscious use of 
scarce natural resources in their business processes and at the same time highlighting the importance of 
health and safety in its workplace and expects the supplier to comply with sustainable business practices 
in letter and spirit in turn for its employees.
The Company supports the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights. It works with its suppliers to ensure that they too are fully aligned with these 
principles.
Succession planning TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and a decentralized 
organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across all business units have resulted in 
a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust succession planning and continuity and 
consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is 
reviewed by senior management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for 
key functions within their units.
Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit heads are 
invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an opportunity to the 
directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.

  Remuneration policy of the Company is designed to create a high-performance culture. It enables the Company to attract, retain

(variable component) to its Managing Director and the Executive Director(s). Annual increments are recommended by the NRC 
within the salary scale approved by the Board and Members and are effective April 1, each year .
  The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the NRC, decides the commission payable to the Managing Director and 
the Executive Director(s) out of the profits for the financial year and within the ceilings prescribed under the Act, based on the 
Board evaluation process considering the criteria such as the performance of the Company as well as that of the Managing 
Director and each Executive Director.
  The Company pays sitting fees of ₹30,000 per meeting to its Non-Executive Directors for attending meetings of the Board 
and meetings of committees of the Board. The Company also pays commission to the Non-Executive Directors within the

The world is witnessing unprecedented advancements in 
technology, transforming the way we live, work, and contribute 
to society. Breakthroughs in AI, big data, blockchain, and digital 
connectivity have not only revolutionized industries but also 
redeﬁned how organizations approach their responsibilities 
toward society and the environment. These technological 
breakthroughs are fostering a new paradigm, one where 
innovation and accountability go hand in hand.
The post-pandemic era has fundamentally reshaped the work 
environment, ushering in a new age of ﬂexibility, innovation, 
and employee-centric practices. There is a requisite for 
businesses to adapt to change with the evident shift being 
towards more empathetic, responsive, and community-oriented 
initiatives.
The role of businesses is no longer conﬁned solely to economic 
value creation. There is a growing expectation for organizations 
to act as conscientious contributors to the greater social good. 
The transferal is towards fostering deeper engagement with 
communities, advocating for environmental stewardship, and 
promoting digital inclusion.
In this evolving landscape, organizations that thrive will be those 
that demonstrate resilience, foresight, and a commitment to 
responsible innovation. Organizations must not only navigate 
complexity with agility but also champion values that reﬂect the 
broader aspirations of society. In doing so, they contribute not 
just to industry leadership, but to a more sustainable, inclusive, 
and equitable future.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) recognizes that meaningful 
transformation lies at the intersection of innovation, human 
ingenuity, and responsible leadership. Guided by this 
philosophy, the organization actively harnesses emerging 
technologies and forward-thinking solutions to build a more 
equitable and inclusive world. TCS’ eﬀorts extend beyond 
business outcomes, encompassing long-term societal impact 
through scalable, sustainable, and people-centric initiatives.
This commitment is ﬁrmly embedded in TCS’ vision of 
empowering individuals and communities to become 
self-reliant, resilient, and future-ready. By integrating digital 
innovation with community engagement, TCS facilitates access 
to opportunities, knowledge, and tools that enhance 
socio-economic mobility, particularly among women, youth and 
marginalized groups.
TCS continues to lead with purpose, leveraging technology as a 
force for good and reinforcing its role as a trusted partner to 
stakeholders and communities alike.
TCS is playing a key role in empowering people and 
communities, by connecting them to economic opportunities. 
Over the past year, TCS’ programs and initiatives have created a 
lasting generational impact by empowering over 14.75 million 
people globally, particularly in areas where the need is high, 
and resources are the least. 
This ensued upward socio-economic mobility for 1.52 million 
people, building equitable and inclusive pathways for 1.27 
million women, 3,90,690 youth and 1.08 million people from 
marginalized groups. The achievement was made possible by 
scaling TCS’ high-impact programs across India and 50 
countries worldwide, aligning them against four strategic 
themes (and 8 focus areas): provide a 21st century education for 
all (K-12 Education Literacy to Livelihood), help citizens 
equitably access job opportunities (Employment through 
Skilling, Digital Entrepreneurship), enable delivery of world class 
front-line services in poorest districts (Healthcare, Digital

Inclusion), and accelerate the just transition to a green economy 
(Water, Climate and Sustainability). Through its purpose-driven 
ecosystem, TCS collaborates with key stakeholders to address 
the needs of the local communities eﬀectively. 
The long-term evolution of responsible AI is dependent on those 
who shape its future -the next generation of innovators. 
In FY 2025, TCS’ Ignite My Future (IMF) program empowered 
5,857 teachers to inculcate computational thinking while 
equipping 2,66,966 students across 6 continents with 
foundational skills for the AI era. TCS go Innovate Together (goIT) 
program now in its 16th year, has inspired 81,374 students 
across 50 countries to apply 21st Century Skills and latest 
technologies like AI, IoT, and App Design to solve real-world 
problems in their community with 51% of these students being 
girls and 79% from underrepresented minorities.
One of the biggest challenges in India is ensuring access to 
quality jobs for youth from socio-economically and 
geographically disadvantaged communities. TCS Youth 
Employment Program (YEP), now in its 15th year, addresses this 
challenge by equipping undergraduate students and 
unemployed graduates from disadvantaged rural communities 
with marketable skills, industry-relevant credentials, and 
valuable certiﬁcations. In FY 2025, 1,156 students have gained 
employment in the information technology sector and other 
domains through YEP .
Rural communities in India endure innumerable socio-economic 
challenges and have limited economic opportunities to operate 
in the digital economy. Launched over a decade ago, TCS 
BridgeIT program has empowered 1,712 active digital 
entrepreneurs of which 1,508 are women entrepreneurs, 
gearing up to be catalysts to strengthen the rural economy.
The program bridges the socio-economic divide in marginalized 
communities of India, focusing on women and youth by creating 
a network of rural digital entrepreneurs. Across 4,457 villages in 
rural India, these ‘digipreneurs’ are earning their livelihood 
while providing much needed last-mile services to 7,44,697 
beneﬁciaries annually, such as access to citizen entitlements, 
banking, ﬁnancial services, insurance, telehealth, telelaw, 
logistics, e-commerce and more. In FY 2025, BridgeIT’s latest 
project across Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan onboarded 1,400 
women and transformed 1,364 of them as digital 
entrepreneurs serving their villages.
For 25 years TCS Literacy as a Service (LaaS) program has 
addressed the challenge of illiteracy prevalent in India. The 
program has evolved to adapt to the emerging needs especially 
for marginalized communities. From functional literacy that 
included learning basic skills like reading, writing, arithmetic, the 
program now also oﬀers digital and ﬁnancial literacy, key citizen 
entitlement awareness and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).
In FY 2025, the program served 4,12,121 marginalized women 
individuals leading to dignity and social inclusion.
TCS Hours of Purpose by Employees (HOPE) embodies a 
collective movement, by the people, for the people, fueled by 
the Tata group's enduring commitment to community service. 
The year saw 1,46,958 volunteers contribute over 8.93 million 
hours to support the poor with basic necessities, to create 
better health outcomes for those who need help, to preserve 
and protect the environment, to empower better education, 
employment, entrepreneurship, and livelihoods for the 
marginalized communities. TCS employees also built capacity 
and capability for over 100 social sector organizations through 
skill-based volunteering, providing in-kind digital, advisory, and 
technology consulting services.
Globally, TCS has jointly served communities in need through 
10 purpose partnerships in collaboration with other Tata 
group companies, its customers, and like-minded organizations 
through its Business with Purpose program. TCS leveraged the 
insights of over 4,000 cross-sector leaders through 24 Digital 
Empowers thought-leadership forums, using their collective 
expertise to drive global advocacy and policy advancements. 
The world is advancing at an unprecedented pace, making it 
imminent for young people to develop 21st century skills to stay 
informed, create opportunities for new employment, and 
promote economic equity. Emerging technologies, including AI, 
underscore the growing need for skills beyond traditional 
academic subjects, highlighting the importance of a more 
comprehensive and future-oriented education.
TCS’ IMF program is committed to empowering teachers with the 
tools they need to prepare young people to thrive in careers of 
the future.
This pioneering STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics) education program aims at empowering educators 
to integrate Computational Thinking (CT), a foundational 21st 
century skill, into all core subjects. CT is a higher order approach 
to problem solving that uses strategic methods to solve 
problems, just like computer scientists. Knowing that primary 
students will end up with jobs that do not exist yet, CT skills 
prepare them for future careers across industries. 
Through TCS volunteers and customer engagements involving 
program partners, IMF creates awareness on probable job 
opportunities for students by bringing career pathways to life. 
IMF consistently engages with educators and students through 
the Learning Leaders network, family STEM nights, and special 
student projects.

Inspiring young minds:
Innovation through technology
In Japan, elementary and junior high school education is 
mandatory, ensuring that all children aged 6 to 15 attend 
school. While the national curriculum provides a strong 
foundation, students often have interests that extend 
beyond standard subjects. To bridge this gap, TCS has 
leveraged its IT expertise to develop engaging educational 
initiatives like the TCS’ goIT program, designed to spark 
curiosity and enthusiasm for technology among upper 
elementary students.
As part of this program, students participated in design 
thinking modules, tackling the pressing issue of global 
warming. They explored its severe consequences and 
brainstormed innovative IT-driven solutions to mitigate its 
impact. Each group then presented their ideas to peers and 
teachers, often making their ﬁrst formal presentations. 
Through multiple practice sessions, they reﬁned their 
delivery, building conﬁdence and communication skills.
Beyond deepening their understanding of global warming, 
this hands-on experience fostered critical thinking, teamwork, 
and creative problem-solving, empowering students to 
envision how technology can drive real-world change.
This year, we had the opportunity to hold a 
design thinking class for the ﬁrst time. Our class 
included a wide range of students-those who 
tended to be disruptive, those who were 
distracted by tablets, and those who struggled 
to fully understand Japanese. Despite these 
challenges, all 90 students stood proudly to 
deliver their presentations, leaving both myself 
and the homeroom teachers deeply moved.
The classes provided by TCS Japan allowed us 
to witness the growth of our students 
ﬁrsthand. Thank you for giving our children this 
valuable experience.

Rural communities in India face numerous socio-economic 
challenges, including limited job access and lack of 
awareness of Government, ﬁnancial, and online services 
thus restricting economic opportunities for generations. Poor 
infrastructure, limited resources, and technological gaps 
further hinder their participation in the digital economy.
TCS BridgeIT program addresses the socio-economic divide 
in marginalized communities of India, especially among 
women and the youth, by creating rural digital 
entrepreneurs. The program bridges the digital divide, builds 
a rural entrepreneurship ecosystem and enables social 
integration.

the skills, technology, mentorship, and resources required to 
set up a Digital Service Centre and provide essential services. 
These ‘digipreneurs’, use information technology to help 
others in the local community avail Government 
entitlements by providing ﬁnancial and digital services in 
education, employment, and adult literacy. 
BridgeIT capitalizes on VLC (Village Livelihood Committee), a 
social safety net which helps to identify and support budding 
entrepreneurs;  and DEEco (Digital Entrepreneur Ecosystem) 
which fosters sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems, 
facilitates diverse business ventures and promotes economic 
growth.
Personalized learning was delivered using the TCS DELI 
(Digital Entrepreneur Learning Intervention) framework that 
indirectly assesses deeper learning needs while mentorship 
from experienced entrepreneurs was leveraged using the 
“Didi ka Darbar” platform. TEN (TCS Entrepreneurs 
Networks) platform helped entrepreneurs connect,

Prabhasini Baral, from Palli 
village, had always dreamed of 
earning her own living but 
lacked formal education. When 
she heard about LaaS classes at 
the village community center 
from a friend, she seized the 
opportunity. 
Starting with the basics, 
learning the alphabet and 
arithmetic, Prabhasini, gained 
conﬁdence. She also discovered 
the power of knowledge 
beyond literacy, learning about 
disaster preparedness and the 
importance of essential 
documents like a bank 
passbook, Aadhaar card, and
PAN card.
With her newfound skills, Prabhasini applied for the 
Subhadra Yojana scheme using her mobile phone and 
secured ﬁnancial assistance. Investing wisely, she 
purchased a cow, and today, she earns a steady income by 
selling milk in her village, turning a simple resource into a 
sustainable livelihood.
Her success was further fueled by LaaS’ collaboration with 
Tata Sustainability Group (TSG) and the Youth Council for 
Development Alternatives (YCDA). This initiative, dedicated 
to uplifting those aﬀected by Cyclone Fani in Puri, Odisha, 
empowered Prabhasini and many others with LaaS’ ﬁve 
literacy oﬀerings. Several women beneﬁciaries, part of 
Self-Help Groups (SHG), have enrolled under the Mission 
Shakti scheme which helps them achieve socio-economic 
independence. Today Prabhasini, stands as a beacon of 
hope, proving that with knowledge and determination, 
dreams can turn into reality.

My social wellbeing journey started early in 
life during my travels to one of the premiere 
spiritual organizations in West Bengal. We had 
close ties with this institute, and growing up, I 
participated in many events organized by their 
monks. When I joined TCS, my social venture 
continued. From fund raising for education to 
supporting a needy mother for her dialysis, I 
could always count on my colleagues to rise to 
the occasion.
During the pandemic, I worked with a 
non-proﬁt engaging in the wellbeing of HIV 
positive children and was touched by their 
passion, honesty and humility. Since then, I’ve 
been supporting them and would like to help 
them expand a set-up that employs HIV 
positive young adults, post institutional care. 
During a recent visit, one of TCS’ customers 
visited them and was greatly impressed. I 
promote the volunteerism spirit within the 
unit. Recently, the entire unit contributed 
whole-heartedly towards Wayanad relief 
work. I admire my team for their active 
volunteering towards causes that matter.

would otherwise spend hours daily recording every piece of 
student data manually. HHHF leaders spoke highly about the 
beneﬁts of the new platform as automating processes have 
signiﬁcantly brought down manual errors.
TCS volunteers also upgraded Lake Gardens Women & 
Children Development Centre’s (LGWCDC) website to 
improve the user experience of the website. According to 
LGWCDC representatives, the updated website has been a 
boon, accelerating operations signiﬁcantly.
Leaders with Purpose (LwP) is a nine-month immersive

Social Innovation
Digital Impact Square (DISQ)
TCS’ Social Innovation acknowledges the criticality of social 
change and inclusion around the world. The Company 
capitalises on its intellectual and technological capital while 
leveraging it contextual knowledge, as well as the collective 
knowledge of a diverse network of subject matter experts, to 
provide pro bono digital services to social sector organisations. 
Through this, TCS delivers innovative solutions for speciﬁc 
problems unique to the community in question.
This year, DISQ startup teams had the opportunity to present 
their work at a startup demonstration event during the 
Chairman's visit to one of India's Farmer Producer Company. 
During the event, emerging entrepreneurs shared their 
achievements and received insightful feedback from him. 
TCS’ Digital Impact Square (DISQ) is an incubation program 
for early-stage startups which is oriented towards community 
inclusion. This social innovation platform encourages the 
youth to harness the power of digital technology and develop 
solutions for lasting change in society, including assistive 
technology for persons with disabilities. The young 
innovators are oﬀered skill-building, mentorship, and seed 
funds for their solutions.

Financial Skills in India

continued with the TCS Digital Empowers Sustainathon, 
developed with a client partner, to support the non-proﬁt 
organization Human-I-T. Additionally, the initiative embarked 
on two deep research projects, generating insights and 
recommendations for long-term, system level improvements.
Working toward the Digital Opportunity Playbook, a research 
initiative to be published in early FY 2026, Digital Empowers 
conducted nearly 70 interviews about digital equity with 
business, Government and non-proﬁt leaders in Chicago, 
Dallas, Detroit, New York, and beyond. In Canada, the “Digital 
Skills Imperative" report, developed with a partner, was 
published in December 2024.
In India, Digital Empowers facilitated collaboration between 
Tata group companies, key social development organizations, 
and Government agencies. These eﬀorts aligned with CSR 
programs through the event series:
This culminated in the pan-India celebration, Empowering 
Women, Inspiring India, marking International Women’s Day 
with a series of events across ten TCS oﬃces. The initiative 
brought together nearly 2,500 employees, business leaders, 
and beneﬁciaries from TCS CSR programs. Women from CSR 
initiatives—including TCS  support staﬀ and young 
professionals from LaaS and YEP—spoke about how  gaining 
education, digital skills, and employment shaped their 
journeys. Partners and participants from goIT, IMF, and 
BridgeIT also shared their perspectives. Senior business 
leaders and Delivery Center Heads joined, reﬂecting strong 
collaboration. Empowering Women, Inspiring India was a 
meaningful reminder that investing in women’s empowerment 
strengthens communities and TCS.
In FY 2025, Digital Empowers established 9 cross-sector 
partnerships, engaged 4,065 participants across 24 events and 
22 client engagements. 
Collaborating to drive digital inclusion in Canada
Some of the trends identiﬁed by the group include the slow 
pace of Government and higher education as they try to 
keep up with technology’s evolution, immigration, 
deglobalization and the movement toward 
micro-credentialing. Proposed solutions, published by 
Digital Empowers and its partner in December 2024, 
included recommendations for big businesses to lead digital 
skilling eﬀorts, for more collaboration between institutions 
oﬀering micro-credentials and employers posting actual 
jobs, for shifting Government regulation and assessment 
from its oversight of individual courses to regulation of the 
digital skilling organizations themselves, and more.
Recognizing that many are poised to be left behind in the 
current and future Canadian economy, TCS’ Digital 
Empowers, along with a partner, held the roundtable, Digital 
Skills Imperative, focused on ways to advance digital 
inclusion. Participants included a board of trade, a 
communications and entertainment company, and TCS’ 
inﬂuential CSR partners.

Disaster relief eﬀorts help alleviate the adverse impact of 
natural and human-made catastrophes on local communities. 
The recent landslides in Wayanad triggered by relentless 
monsoon led to widespread soil erosion and landslides,

life-cycle approach to TCS’ core operations is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services 
and products procured by TCS for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the 
life cycle philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications for 
purchase and end-of-life management to maximize recycling.
2. If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products/
services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same

consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.
 TCS consults stakeholders on material topics and also conducts periodic materiality assessments to update the list on an ongoing 
basis. Stakeholder interactions result in the identification of a broad funnel of issues important to each of the constituencies. The 
Company uses discussions with internal and external stakeholders, as well as its own judgment, to prioritize and arrive at a list of 
material topics with significant economic, environmental, or social impacts on TCS’ business, reputation, and operations. The TCS 
management shares feedback with the Board on these issues.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics 
(Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated 
into policies and activities of the entity.

prioritized based on their impact on stakeholders and business and are included in the section titled ‘Sustainability Disclosures’, 
which forms part of this Integrated Annual Report.
3. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/marginalized 
stakeholder groups.
 TCS' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is committed to build equitable and inclusive pathways for women, youth, and 
marginalized groups on a meaningful scale and with breakthrough innovations. The organization serves stakeholders in remote 
parts of the world, in areas where the need is high, and resources are the least. This is realized through programs that address 
the needs of stakeholders in the areas of K-12 education, literacy to livelihood, employment through skilling, digital inclusion and 
entrepreneurship.

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment 
Environmental Sustainability at TCS:
TCS has embraced the precautionary principle and recognized carbon footprint mitigation and environmental protection along with 
resource optimization as a key priority area. It is driven by the belief that sustainability-driven decisions are essential to business success. 
TCS’ Environmental Sustainability Policy articulates this vision and mission. The Stakeholder Relationship Committee oversees the carbon 
and environmental strategy and performance, demonstrating strong commitment at senior-most levels of the organization.
TCS is certified to ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS) standard across 129 of its facilities worldwide in FY 2025. 
These certified locations constitute 82% of office footprint and 87% of people footprint operating from these locations#. In FY 2025, 
33%  of ISO 14001 certified TCS locations underwent external/third party audits. TCS has induction training for all new employees on 
Environmental Sustainability. In addition to this, an Environmental Sustainability Web Based Training (WBT) program is mandatory for 
all employees which  includes topics such as  Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), energy and climate change, water conservation, 
waste management, biodiversity, responsible consumerism, design thinking for sustainability and what TCS is doing in the field of 
environmental sustainability. This training is followed by bi-annual refresher training and assessment. In FY 2025, 98% employees were 
compliant with the mandatory training requirement.
Essential Indicators
1. Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format73:
 Electricity from the grid is the most significant form of energy for TCS. Over the years, TCS has increased the share of Renewable 
Electricity (RE) through “green-tariff ” schemes offered by the state electricity providers, onsite rooftop solar generation and 
procurement from third party producers in India and  procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC). The renewable energy 
consumption as a percentage of total energy consumption has increased from 74% in FY 2024 to 79% in FY 2025. The renewable 
electricity attributed to 85% of total electricity consumption during the year (refer to table below). Electricity consumption across 
TCS operations increased by 11% YoY on account of increased operations due to return to office and inclusion of additional locations 
in the reporting boundary. There is a 4.3% increase in overall electricity consumption due to inclusion of additional locations in the 
reporting boundary. Other sources of energy include natural gas (mainly used for space heating/cooling, district heating and cooling, 
mostly in overseas geographies), fuel used in company owned vehicles, cooking gas used in cafeteria and diesel used in diesel 
generators (mainly used as a back-up source during power shortages).
 Details of total energy consumption [in Mega Joules (MJ)] and energy intensity are provided below:

which outlines Industry Standards Forum guidance for BRSR Core. The PPP factor has been sourced from IMF database. The 
restatement has led to a revision of prior reported value of 0.016234 for the year ended March 31, 2024
 **The year end headcount data (as on March 31, 2025) has been used for the intensity calculations.
#Only delivery centers are included in these certifications as per the following criteria: >200 seats from India and >50 seats from overseas. The % of certified 
centers would vary YoY due to addition/closure of facilities depending on business requirements.

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details78.
 Yes. TCS is executing projects related to reducing GHG emissions to meet the carbon targets. 
 Commitment to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
 TCS has committed to SBTi and the Near-Term Targets are given below. SBTi has classified TCS’s scope 1 and 2 target, in line with a 
1.5°C trajectory.  
 • TCS commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 90% by FY 2030 from a FY 2016 base year .  
 • TCS also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions 35% by FY 2034 from a FY 2020 base year . 
 To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled 
operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.
 Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:
 All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have roof-top 
solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total built-up area occupied by TCS has increased YoY from 38.2 million 
sq.ft. to  40.6 million sq.ft. in FY 2025. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its green footprint, to align 
with its sustainability goals. In FY 2025, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional buildings and  Gold certification for 3 additional 
buildings. The green certified area in India has increased from 67.3% to 71% over the total built-up area.  This accounts for 45 TCS offices 
and campuses with over 28.8 million sq.ft. of area under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.
 During the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT infrastructure. 
Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) and chillers. 
The specific initiatives are as below:
 • HVAC system upgradation by installation of latest technology VRF systems which works on inverter technology.
 • Use of High Efficiency VFD based chillers.
 • Replacement of R-22 based and fixed compressor-based HVAC equipment with inverter technology-based equipment.
 • Modular UPS which can modulate its capacity based on load and helps provide 90-95% efficiency, even at lower loads.
 • Life cycle-based replacement of HVAC equipment like chillers, pumps and cooling towers has helped reduce TCS’ energy 
consumption.
 • Energy optimization in the Company’s operations through iOT based solutions, remote monitoring, analytics and automated 
feedback mechanism.
 • As a commitment to energy conservation and management, the Company has continued to implement initiatives, monitor 
and measure energy performance at 22 of TCS’ ISO 50001:2018 certified campuses in India, conducted internal audits at 
100% of the certified campuses and have undertaken external audits by TUV Nord for continuing TCS’ certification to Energy 
Management Systems (EnMS).
 Green IT:
 Initiatives in Green Information Technology (Green IT) focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce 
the carbon footprint. The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data centers and equipment 
rooms. TCS’ data centers have a weighted average PUE of 1.59 (FY 2025) compared to PUE of 1.7 (FY 2024). Apart from the two main 
data centers, TCS also has 54 equipment rooms for business as usual (BAU) activities, wherein the weighted average PUE was 1.79 
in FY 2025. TCS  data centres  use 100% RE. The total power consumed by  TCS data centers was 6.6 GWh  during the reporting year

FY 2025. In addition to the above, green attributes are considered in every IT asset procurement.
 TCS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize 
the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe 
Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone, enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ 
energy meters and sensors. Other energy optimization initiatives include:
 • IT Equipment optimization (rack consolidation, server consolidation and procurement of energy efficient devices)
 • UPS optimization (right sizing of UPS, replacement of old technology UPS with modular UPS)
 • Cooling optimization (switching off excess capacity cooling units, maintaining return set temperature at 24 +/- 1° C, replacing old 
with new technology cooling units) 
 • Leakage reduction (proper alignment of racks and perforated tiles, partitioning to reduce cooling area, cold aisle containment, 
blanking panel, active tiles and soft partitioning)
 Renewable Energy:
 The roof top solar photovoltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 2.7% of total electricity use in FY 2025. 
The Company continued its procurement of renewable energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), switching over to green 
tariffs and procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). The onsite solar generation and renewable energy procurement have 
resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 79% of total energy use.
9. Provide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format79:
 TCS is primarily an IT services and consulting organization, and therefore does not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals in its 
core processes. The Company has office or facility operations, and the waste is generated from the auxiliary processes used to 
run these facilities. Based on the nature of its services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic, electrical, and municipal solid 
waste. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil are generated in relatively smaller 
proportions which are disposed through government-approved recyclers as per regulations. E-waste is disposed to government 
approved e-waste recyclers.
 TCS is committed to sustain the best practices that have already been institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes, 
100% compliance to management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and maximizing recycling of office 
papers, packaging paper and plastics. TCS focuses on elimination of single-use plastics to ensure that the impact on environment and 
ecosystems is minimal. E-waste is one of key wastes generated from Company’s facilities and the Company has a process to manage 
and handle e-wastes at TCS. TCS follows a stringent process for conducting due diligence prior to finalizing an authorized e-waste 
disposal/recycling vendor . TCS facilities ensure safe disposal of the e-waste to the authorized recycler as per regulatory requirement 
in respective geographies.
 All TCS campuses, owned offices and leased offices that have available space are provided with on-site food waste management 
facilities such as biodigesters and organic waste converters (OWCs) and garden waste is treated by vermicomposting at TCS campuses 
where feasible. TCS targets to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL) for all TCS’ campuses by 2030 and plans to maximize the recycling 
and reuse of all waste categories to divert waste away from landfill.
 In FY 2025, TCS has obtained ZWL certification for 8 additional campuses taking the ZWL certified campuses to 9.
 TCS has operational control procedures (OCPs) for waste management and handling of different categories of wastes and has set 
procedures for waste segregation, handling, storage, and disposal of different waste categories.

Other information
The Company’s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Company’s Integrated Annual Report (but does not include the BRSR Core attributes and assurance report 
thereon). 
Additionally, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and issued an independent assurance 
report on 27 May 2025. Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our reasonable assurance opinion on the BRSR Core attributes does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our assurance report of the BRSR Core attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the BRSR Core attributes, our knowledge obtained in the 
assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that 
we obtained prior to the date of this reasonable assurance report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core attributes, the 
reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared 
and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter .
Management’s responsibilities for the identified Sustainability Information (ISI) 
The management of the Company acknowledges for: 
• designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
• selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the ISI, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, if any, related to 
reporting on the ISI, identification of key aspects, engagement with stakeholders, content, preparation and presentation of the ISI in 
accordance with the reporting criteria; disclosure of the applicable criteria used for preparation of the ISI in the relevant report; 
• preparing, fairly stating and properly calculating the ISI in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
• ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanations;
• establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such targets, goals and 
performance measures;
• providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in the report;
• ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;

the reporting criteria; 
• preventing and detecting fraud;

Inherent limitations 
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations 
about the relevance of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information.
Measurement of certain amounts with respect to the BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG Footprint, Water Footprint, Energy Footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to 
support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
• Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the BRSR Core are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above; 
• Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and
• Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and performed 
our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion. 
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material 
misstatement through understanding the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained 
an understanding of the internal control relevant to the ISI covered by reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out 
our engagement, we:
• assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by reasonable assurance; 
• evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the preparation of the ISI covered by 
reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company; and 
• evaluated the overall presentation of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance.
Exclusions
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on the same:
• Any form of review of the commercial merits, technical feasibility, accuracy, compliance with applicable legislation for the project. We 
are not required to verify any of the judgements and commercial risks associated with the project, nor comment upon the possibility 
of the financial projections being achieved.
• The Company’s statements that describe the strategy, progress on goals (other than those listed under the scope of assurance), 
expression of opinion, claims, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim to future intention provided by the Company, and assertions related 
to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.
• Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
• Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
• Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.

Consolidated Financial Statements 
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of  
Tata Consultancy Services Limited  
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tata 
Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and 
its subsidiaries referred to as “the Group”), which comprise 
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other 
comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year 
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, 
including material accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial 
statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the 
Group as at 31 March 2025, of its consolidated profit and other 
comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in 
terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence 
obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.

Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognised using percentage of completion method
See Note 5(a) and Note 12 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts, wherein, 
revenue is recognised using the percentage of completion 
computed as per the input method based on the Group’s 
estimate of contract costs.
We identified revenue recognition of fixed price contracts 
where the percentage of completion is used as a key audit 
matter since -
• there is an inherent risk and presumed fraud risk around 
the accuracy and existence of revenues recognised 
considering the customised and complex nature of these 
contracts and significant inputs of IT systems;
• application of revenue recognition using percentage 
of completion under accounting standard (Ind AS 115, 
Revenue from Contracts with customers) is complex and 
involves estimating the future cost-to-completion of 
these contracts, which is used to measure the stage of 
completion of the relevant performance obligation;
• these contracts may involve onerous obligations which 
requires critical assessment of foreseeable losses to be 
made by the Group; and
• at year-end, significant amount of contract assets, 
unearned and deferred revenue balances related to these 
contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.
Our audit procedures included the following:
• Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and 
controls implemented by the Group for recording and computing 
revenue and the associated contract assets, unearned and 
deferred revenue balances.
• Involved our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required 
and assessed the IT environment in which the business systems 
operate.
• Evaluated the design and implementation and tested operating 
effectiveness of Group’s key manual and automated internal 
financial controls over .
  Computation of revenue recognition;
  Cost and revenue reports generated by the system
  Allocation of resources and budgeting systems which prevent 
the unauthorised recording/changes to costs incurred; and
  Estimation of contract costs required to complete the 
respective projects.
• On specific and statistically selected samples of contracts, we 
tested that the revenue recognised is in accordance with the 
revenue recognition accounting standard. This includes testing 
the Group’s computation of the estimation of contract costs and 
onerous obligations, if any, where we:
  assessed that the estimates of costs to complete were 
reviewed and approved by appropriate designated 
management personnel;
  performed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred 
with estimated costs to identify significant variations and 
challenged whether those variations are required to be 
considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete 
the contract;
  assessed the appropriateness of contract assets, unearned 
and deferred revenue on balance sheet date by evaluating 
the progress of underlying contracts, milestones achieved to 
identify possible changes in estimated costs to complete the 
remaining performance obligations; and;
  inspected underlying documents and performed substantive 
procedures over cost budget changes to determine 
reasonableness of contract costs.
• Tested details of a sample of journal entries related to revenue 
recognised from percentage of completion method throughout 
the reporting period, using risk- based criteria, with the relevant 
underlying documentation.
• Assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements.

Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s 
Annual report, but does not include the financial statements 
and auditor’s reports thereon. The Holding Company’s Annual 
report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
When we read the Holding Company’s annual report, if we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are 
required to communicate the matter to those charged with 
governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the 
relevant laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’/Trustees Responsibilities 
for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these 
consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of 
the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of 
affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated 
cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the 
Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors /Trustees 
of the companies/entities included in the Group are responsible 
for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each 
company/entity and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the 
purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective 
Management and Board of Directors of the companies/Trustees 
of the entities are responsible for assessing the ability of each 
company/entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of 
Directors/Trustees either intends to liquidate the Company/entity 
or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies/Trustees of 
the entities are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of each company/entity.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of 
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board of 
Directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25
 172
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other entities included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of 
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2A(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal 
and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even 
date)
Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year 
ended 31 March 2025, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company and such companies incorporated in India under the 
Companies Act, 2013, which are its subsidiary companies, as of 
that date.
In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies 
incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, 
in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such internal financial 
controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based 
on the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by such companies considering 
the essential components of such internal controls stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The respective company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the respective company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements were established 
and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements include 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and


## Page 180

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25
177
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1) Corporate information
 Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and its 
subsidiaries (collectively together with employee welfare 
trusts referred to as “the Group”) provide IT services, 
consulting and business solutions and have been partnering 
with many of the world’s largest businesses in their 
transformation journeys. The Group offers a consulting-
led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business 
and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered 
through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery 
model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software 
development.
 The Company is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is  
TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at 
March 31, 2025, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding 
company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share 
capital. 
 The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 
authorised for issue on April 10, 2025.
2) Statement of compliance
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.
3) Basis of preparation
 These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured 
at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting 
period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of 
the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. All 
assets and liabilities have been classified as current and 
non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle. 
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and 
time elapsed between deployment of resources and the 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration 
for such services rendered, the Group has considered an 
operating cycle of 12 months.   
 The statement of cash flows has been prepared under 
indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals 
or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and items of income or expense associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from 
operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are 
segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value 
to be cash equivalents.
 The functional currency of the Company and its Indian 
subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`). The functional currency 
of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates. Foreign 
currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates 
prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency 
denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates 
and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and 
restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and 
loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not 
retranslated.
 The material accounting policy information related to 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements have 
been discussed in the respective notes.
4) Basis of consolidation
 The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled 
by it.
 The Company establishes control when; it has power over 
the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities 
of the entity.
 Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from 
the date control commences until the date control ceases.
 The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year 
are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and 
up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
 The financial statements of the Group companies are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated 
in full on consolidation.
 Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do 
not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s 
interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted 
to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which 
the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value 
of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in 
equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.
 Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency 
other than the functional currency of the Company have 
been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such 
entities has been translated using weighted average 
exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been reported 
as foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of 
changes in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed 
off in its entirety or partially such that control, significant

influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount 
of exchange differences related to that foreign operation 
recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit and 
loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
5) Use of estimates and judgements
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with the recognition and measurement principles 
of Ind AS requires management of the Group to make 
estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances 
of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities 
as at the date of consolidated financial statements and the 
reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods 
presented.
 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised 
and future periods are affected.
 The Group uses the following critical accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions in preparation of its consolidated 
financial statements:
 (a) Revenue recognition
  Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised 
using percentage-of-completion method. The Group 
estimates the future cost-to-completion of the contracts 
which is used to determine degree of completion of the 
performance obligation.
  The Group exercises judgement for identification of 
performance obligations, determination of transaction 
price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation and in determining whether the 
performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time 
or over a period of time. These judgements have been 
explained in detail under the revenue recognition note 
(Refer note 12).
 (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
  The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and 
equipment at the end of each reporting period. This 
reassessment may result in change in depreciation 
expense in future periods (Refer note 10(a)).
 (c) Impairment of goodwill
  The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash 
generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows 
after considering current economic conditions and 
trends, estimated future operating results and growth 
rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory 
conditions. The estimated cash flows are developed 
using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the 
CGUs represent the weighted average cost of capital 
based on the historical market returns of comparable 
companies (Refer note 10(b)).
 (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments
  When the fair value of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs 
to these models are taken from observable markets 
where possible, but where this is not feasible, a 
degree of judgement is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes 
in assumptions about these factors could affect the 
reported fair value of financial instruments.
 (e) Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair 
value)
  Measurement of impairment of financial assets require 
use of estimates, which have been explained in the 
note on financial assets, financial liabilities and equity 
instruments, under impairment of financial assets 
(other than at fair value) (Refer note 8)).
 (f) Deferred tax assets
  A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences 
and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group 
exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount 
of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting 
period.
 (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities
  The Group estimates the provisions that have present 
obligations as a result of past events and it is probable 
that outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end 
of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimates. 
  The Group uses significant judgements to assess 
contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed 
when there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed only 
by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
the Group or a present obligation that arises from past 
events where it is either not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. 
Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed 
in the consolidated financial statements.
 (h) Employee benefits 
  The accounting of employee benefit plans in the 
nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use 
assumptions. These assumptions have been explained 
under employee benefits note (Refer note 14).
 (i) Leases
  The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to 
be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. 
The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the

Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25
 186
lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the 
applicable discount rate. 
  The Group determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease, together with both 
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the 
Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and 
periods covered by an option to terminate the lease 
if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that 
option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably 
certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not 
to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers 
all relevant facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option 
to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to 
terminate the lease. The Group revises the lease term 
if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a 
lease. 
  The discount rate is generally based on the incremental 
borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or 
for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.
6) Recent pronouncements
 Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards 
or amendments to the existing standards under Companies  
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to 
time. For the year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified 
Ind AS – 117 Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind 
AS 116 – Leases, relating to sale and leaseback transactions, 
applicable to the Group w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Group 
has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on 
its evaluation has determined that it does not have any 
significant impact in its financial statements. 
7) Business combinations
 The Group accounts for its business combinations under 
acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition 
for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date.
 Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of 
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair 
value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of 
acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets 
and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital 
reserve.
 The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, 
the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the 
amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-
controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity 
of subsidiaries.
 Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in 
entities that are under common control are accounted at 
historical cost. The difference between any consideration 
given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in 
shareholders’ equity.
 Acquisition that does not meet the definition of ‘business’ 
in accordance with Ind AS - 103 Business Combinations is 
treated as acquisition of assets.
8)  Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments
 Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which 
are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial 
assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured 
on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability. 
 The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or 
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only 
when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or 
have expired.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash 
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances 
with banks and which are unrestricted for withdrawal and 
usage.
 Financial assets at amortised cost
 Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost if these financial assets are held within a business 
whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
  Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income
 Financial assets are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
 The Group has made an irrevocable election to present 
subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments 
not held for trading in other comprehensive income.

187
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit 
or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in 
statement of profit and loss.  
 Financial liabilities
 Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
 Equity instruments
 An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual 
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of 
its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are 
recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.
 Derivative accounting
 • Instruments in hedging relationship
  The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward, 
currency options and futures contracts as hedge 
instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These 
hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
  The Group uses hedging instruments that are governed 
by the financial risk management policy as approved by 
the Risk Management Committee. The policy provides 
principles on the use of such financial derivatives 
consistent with the risk management strategy of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. While determining 
the appropriate hedge ratio, the Group takes into 
consideration the prevailing macro-economic conditions, 
the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments, 
tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness and the costs 
of hedging. The hedging activities are reviewed by the 
Risk Management Committee every quarter and future 
course of action is determined.
  The hedge instruments are designated and documented 
as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Group 
determines the existence of an economic relationship 
between the hedging instrument and hedged item 
based on the currency, amount and timing of their 
respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge 
instruments to reduce the risk associated with the 
exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at 
inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future 
cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the 
amounts that have been accumulated in other equity 
are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange 
gains in the statement of profit and loss.
  The effective portion of change in the fair value of the 
designated hedging instrument is recognised in the 
other comprehensive income and accumulated under 
the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
  The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value 
of an option and designates as hedging instruments 
only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The 
change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value 
of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive 
income and accounted as a separate component of 
equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement 
of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect 
profit and loss.
  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or 
loss recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity till that time remains and is 
recognised in statement of profit and loss when the 
forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and 
loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes 
ineffective.
 • Instruments not in hedging relationship
  The Group enters into contracts that are effective as 
hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not 
qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair 
value of such instrument is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.
 Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)
 The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether 
a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. 
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured 
through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime 
expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade 
receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In 
determining the allowance for expected credit losses, the 
Group has used a practical expedient by computing the 
expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on 
a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account 
historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward 
looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is 
based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and 
allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other 
financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an 
amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at 
an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the 
credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly 
since initial recognition.

 Loans include inter-corporate deposits of `170 crore, with original maturity period within 24 months.
 Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, 
approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial 
assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their 
nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried 
at amortised cost is  `279 crore and `1,215 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
(j) Fair value hierarchy
 The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or 
unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
 • Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 • Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 • Level 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in 
part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market 
transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
 The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide 
range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.
 The following table summarises financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and financial assets that are 
not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (but fair value disclosures are required):

(k) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity
 The Group’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are 
denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations. 
 The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk 
management plan of the Group which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the 
guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, 
currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.
 The following are outstanding currency options contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges:

 The Group has entered into derivative instruments not in hedging relationship by way of foreign exchange forward, currency options 
and futures contracts. As at March 31, 2025 and 2024, the notional amount of outstanding contracts aggregated to  `65,004 crore 
and `50,982 crore, respectively, and the respective fair value of these contracts have a net gain of `248 crore and net loss of 
`19 crore.
 Exchange Loss of `488 crore and Gain of `109 crore on foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting have been recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the years ended 
March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
 Net foreign exchange gain / (loss) include loss of `41 crore and `102 crore transferred from cash flow hedging reserve to the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss on occurrence of forecasted hedge transactions for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 
2024, respectively.
 Net loss on derivative instruments of `15 crore recognised in cash flow hedging reserve as at March 31, 2025, is expected to be 
transferred to the statement of profit and loss by March 31, 2026. The maximum period over which the exposure to cash flow 
variability has been hedged is through calendar year 2025.
 Following table summarises approximate gain / (loss) on Group’s other comprehensive income on account of appreciation / 
depreciation of the underlying foreign currencies:

(l) Financial risk management
 The Group is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may 
adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks associated 
with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk 
management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on 
the financial performance of the Group.
 Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest 
rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency 
exchange rate risk.

 • Foreign currency exchange rate risk
  The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and loss 
and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / 
liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering the countries 
and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange 
rates in those countries. 
  The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any 
movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact the 
Group’s revenue in international business.
  The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges 
a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.
  The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous 
parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of Tata Consultancy 
Services Limited and its subsidiaries.
  The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy 
Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive 
income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the 
Group as disclosed in note 8(k).
  The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2025:
(` crore)
USD EUR GBP Others
Net financial assets  2,572  429  115  1,963 
Net financial liabilities  (3,557)  (8)  (337)  (347)
  10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries 
with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Group’s profit before taxes by approximately 
`83 crore for the year ended March 31, 2025.
  The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2024:
(` crore)
USD EUR GBP Others
Net financial assets  2,753  518  161  3,508 
Net financial liabilities  (7,129)  (253)  (2,185)  (753)
  10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries 
with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Group’s profit before taxes by approximately 
`338 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024.
 • Interest rate risk
  The Group’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Group is not significantly exposed to 
interest rate risk.
 Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms 
or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as 
concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis 
to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 5 for methods, assumptions and 
information used to measure expected credit losses.

 Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, 
cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Loans include inter-corporate deposits  of NIL and `170 crore 
placed with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, 
respectively. Bank deposits include an amount of `7,884 crore held with three banks and `5,197 crore held with two banks, having 
high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2025 and 
2024, respectively. None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.
 • Exposure to credit risk
  The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk was `1,17,629 crore and `1,10,345 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, being the total of the 
carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other 
financial assets.
  The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade 
receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2025 and 2024.
 • Geographic concentration of credit risk
  Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:
As at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024
Gross% Net% Gross% Net%
United States of America  35.40  35.87  42.07  42.67 
India  22.51  21.38  18.68  17.44 
United Kingdom  14.72  14.97  16.56  16.86 
  Geographical concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the 
location of the customers.
  The allowance for lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, was 
`112 crore and `98 crore respectively. The reconciliation of allowance for expected credit losses is as follows:

 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is 
to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generated 
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its financial obligations including lease liabilities as and when they fall due.

9) Leases
 A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.  
 Group as a lessee
 The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract 
and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease 
component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components. 
 The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease 
commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and 
removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently 
measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter 
of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis 
as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
 The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date 
of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. 
If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar 
characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the 
incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, 
residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The 
lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the 
carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease 
modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of 
lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the 
nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the 
measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and 
loss.
 The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term 
of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are 
recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 Group as a lessor
 At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group 
recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a 
finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on 
the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease 
and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from 
the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the 
exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

 If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with customers 
to allocate the consideration in the contract.

 Interest on lease liabilities is `631 crore and `518 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
 The Group incurred `343 crore and `353 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, towards expenses 
relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
 The total cash outflow for leases is `2,715 crore and `2,515 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, 
including cash outflow for short term leases and leases of low-value assets.
 The Group has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. The present value of future 
cash outflows for such extension periods is `943 crore and `815 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
 Lease contracts entered by the Group majorly pertain for buildings taken on lease to conduct its business in the ordinary course. 
 The Group does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract.
10) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities
(a) Property, plant and equipment
 The Group recognizes the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can measured reliably.
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the 
asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if 
any.
 Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over 
their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories of assets, 
where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. 
 The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below: 
Type of asset Useful lives
Buildings 20 years*
Leasehold improvements Lease term
Plant and equipment 10 years*
Computer equipment 4 years*
Vehicles 4 years*
Office equipment 2-5 years*
Electrical installations 4-10 years*
Furniture and fixtures 5 years*
 * The Group believes that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best 
represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.

205 Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.
 Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If 
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating 
unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
 The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or 
disposal.

 (b) Goodwill
  Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of the 
acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated impairment 
losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of 
goodwill is less than its carrying amount. 
  CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication for 
impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic uncertainties, 
reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these 
variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit  
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
  Goodwill consists of the following:

  Goodwill of `706 crore and `689 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, has been allocated to the TCS business in 
France. The estimated value-in-use of this CGU, as at March 31, 2025 is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50% annual 
growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate of 9.27%. An analysis of the sensitivity of 
the computation to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on 
reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease 
below its carrying amount.
  The remaining amount of goodwill of `1,154 crore and `1,143 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (relating 
to different CGUs individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and 
the recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts. The estimated value-in-use of these CGUs, as at 
March 31, 2025 is based on the future cash flows using a range of 0.50% - 10.50% annual growth rate for periods subsequent to 
the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate in a range of 5.00% to 23.57%.
 (c) Other intangible assets
  Intangible assets purchased including acquired in business combination, are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as 
applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.
  Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences and customer-related intangibles. 
  Following table summarises the nature of intangibles and their estimated useful lives:
Type of asset Useful lives
Rights under licensing agreement and software licences Lower of licence period and 1-5 years
Customer-related intangibles 3 years
  Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life.
  Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and 
the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
  If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

12) Revenue recognition
 The Group earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Group offers a consulting-led, 
cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.
 Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
 • Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, 
number of transactions processed, etc. 
 • Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide 
services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.
 • In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of 
accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract 
costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  
 • Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is 
recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation 
and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are 
accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method. 
 • Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the 
customer. 
 • The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply 
of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the principal or as 
an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal 
and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.  
 Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, 
performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes 
taxes collected from customers.
 The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Group 
assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification 
of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit 
independently from such deliverables.
 Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration 
with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The 
transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25
213
Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service 
from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is 
highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the 
end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the 
contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.
 The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of 
time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as 
it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, 
transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
 Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for 
capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this 
criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to 
satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.
 Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as 
unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is 
required, as per contractual terms. 
 Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
 The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress 
payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.
 In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received. 
 Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews 
modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new 
performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is 
revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
 The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.
 Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:
(` crore)
Year ended  
March 31, 2025
Year ended  
March 31, 2024
Consultancy services 2,52,045 2,38,135
Sale of equipment and software licences  3,279  2,758 
2,55,324 2,40,893
 Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).
 While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) 
performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Group has 
applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to 
unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the 
value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts. 
 Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, 
changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The 
aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,84,432 crore out of 
which 46.03% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter . No consideration from contracts 
with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

14) Employee benefits
 Defined benefit plans
 For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with 
a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and 
unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity 
recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits. 
 The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available 
refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
 The Group provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are 
treated as defined benefit plans.
 Defined contribution plans
 Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to 
such benefits.
 The Group provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) and foreign defined 
contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.
 Short-term employee benefits
 All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. 
Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders 
the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
 Compensated absences
 Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee 
renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are 
not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are 
recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

 Gratuity and pension
 In accordance with Indian law, Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries in India operate a scheme of gratuity which 
is a defined benefit plan. The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in 
employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year 
of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. 
Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. Certain overseas subsidiaries and branches of the Company also provide for 
retirement benefit pension plans in accordance with the local laws.
 The following table sets out the details of the defined benefit retirement plans and the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements:

 The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plan are set out below:
As at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024
Domestic plans Foreign plans Domestic plans Foreign plans
Discount rate  6.50% - 6.75% 1.10% - 9.40%  7.00% - 7.25%  1.57% - 9.40% 
Rate of increase in compensation levels of  covered 
employees
6.00% - 10.00% 1.25% - 7.00%  5.00% - 10.00%  1.75% - 7.00% 
Rate of return on plan assets  6.50% - 6.75%  1.10% - 9.40%  7.00% - 7.25%  1.57% - 9.40% 
Weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations  6-12 Years  3-27 Years  2-11 Years  3-27 Years 
 Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of 
India.
 The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as 
at March 31, 2025. The Group is expected to contribute `40 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending  
March 31, 2026 comprising domestic component of `7 crore and foreign component of `33 crore.
 The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary 
increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
 If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:
(` crore)
As at  
March 31, 2025
As at  
March 31, 2024
Increase of 0.50% (318) (272)
Decrease of 0.50% 350 300
 If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:
(` crore)
As at  
March 31, 2025
As at  
March 31, 2024
Increase of 0.50% 198 163
Decrease of 0.50% (190) (157)
 The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
 Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the 
defined benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet.
 Each year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed 
in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.
 The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2025 as follows:
(` crore)
Year ending March 31, Defined benefit 
obligations

 Provident fund
 In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up 
by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan 
as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared 
by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to the Government administered 
pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit and 
loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance 
issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as 
the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual 
members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.
 All eligible employees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which 
both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident fund plan. A 
part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to the Government administered pension fund. This plan is a defined contribution 
plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund. The contributions made to the fund 
are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.
 The following table sets out the details of the defined benefit provident fund plan and the amounts recognised in the financial

17) Income taxes
 Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year . Current 
and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
 Current income taxes
 The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas. 
 The Company has recognised income tax expenses applying the provisions under section 115BAA of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
 Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the 
jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax 
liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
 The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary in 
the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.
 Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations 
are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
 Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and 
income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability 
on a net basis.

 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published the model rules for global minimum tax (Pillar 
Two model rules). Pillar Two legislation has been enacted, or substantively enacted, in certain jurisdictions where the Group operates. 
The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules and has evaluated the potential exposure to global minimum tax. 
The Group does not expect any material financial impact for the current period. The evaluation of the potential exposure is based on 
the most recent country-by-country reporting, and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group.
 Deferred income taxes
 Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except 
when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. 
 Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
 The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
 Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the 
years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant 
entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
 Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be 
available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance 
sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be 
realised.
 The income tax expense consists of the following:

 Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, unabsorbed business losses expire 8 years after the year in which they originate. In respect of 
certain foreign subsidiaries, business losses can be carried forward indefinitely unless there is a substantial change in the ownership.
 Unrecognised deferred tax assets relate primarily to business losses and tax credit entitlements which do not qualify for recognition 
as per the applicable accounting standards. These unabsorbed business losses will expire based on the year of origination as follows:

 Deferred tax liability on temporary differences of `8,352 crore as at March 31, 2025, associated with investments in subsidiaries, has 
not been recognised, as it is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries for the 
foreseeable future. 
 Direct tax contingencies 
 The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with income tax authorities in India and in some of the other jurisdictions 
where they operate. The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deduction, computation or eligibility of tax 
incentives and allowances and characterisation of fees for services received. Contingent liability in respect of tax demands received 
from direct tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions is `1,073 crore and `1,871 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 
respectively. These demand orders are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation 
and advise of tax consultants. In respect of tax contingencies of `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, 
respectively, not included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller of TCS e-Serve Limited.

jurisdictions it operates in. The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that any consequent income tax 
claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.
 The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction. The major tax jurisdictions of Tata 
Consultancy Services Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom. In India, tax filings from fiscal 2022 are 
generally subject to examination by the tax authorities. In United States of America, the federal statute of limitation applies to fiscals

applies to fiscal 2019 and earlier .

19)  Segment information
 Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated 
regularly by the chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Group’s chief 
operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.
 The Group has identified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable segments. The business segments comprise: 
1) Banking, Financial Services and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Consumer Business, 4) Communication, Media and Technology, 
5) Life Sciences and Healthcare and 6) Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, s-Governance and Products. 
 Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses which are not 
directly identifiable to each reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of associated revenue of the segment. All other 
expenses which are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable expenses.
 The assets and liabilities of the Group are used interchangeably amongst segments. Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not 
practicable and any forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation. Hence assets and liabilities have not been 
identified to any of the reportable segments. 
 Summarised segment information for the years ended March 31,2025 and 2024, is as follows:

 Capital commitments
 The Group has contractually committed (net of advances) `2,574 crore and `2,032 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 
respectively, for purchase of property, plant and equipment.
 Contingencies
 • Direct tax matters
  Refer note 17.
 • Indirect tax matters
  The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with tax authorities mainly relating to treatment of characterisation 
and classification of certain items. The Company and its subsidiaries have demands amounting to `1,190 crore and `1,161 crore 
as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, from various indirect tax authorities which are being contested by the Company 
and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advice of tax consultants.  
 • Other claims
   Claims aggregating `248 crore and `226 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, against the Group have not 
been acknowledged as debts.
   In April 2019, Computer Sciences Corporation (referred to as CSC) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court 
of Northern District of Texas and Dallas Division (trial court) alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and other CSC’s 
confidential information and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and unspecified monetary damages and 
disgorgement of profits.
  A trial before an advisory jury was held and on November 17, 2023, the jury returned an advisory verdict in favour of CSC, 
finding that the Company misappropriated CSC’s trade secrets and recommended compensation of US $70 million (equivalent 
to `598 crore) and a further punitive damage of US $140 million (equivalent to `1,196 crore) to be paid by the Company to 
CSC. Subsequently, the parties filed their respective written submissions in the matter . On June 13, 2024, the trial court passed a 
judgement as follows:
 1. The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for US $56 million (equivalent to `478 crore) in compensatory damages 
and US $112 million (equivalent to `957 crore) in exemplary damages.
 2. The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for US $26 million (equivalent to `222 crore) in prejudgment interest 
through June 13, 2024.
 3. The Court also passed certain injunction and other reliefs against the Company.
  Pursuant to US Court procedures, a Letter of Credit has been made available to CSC for `2,136 crore (US $250 million) as 
financial security in order to stay execution of the judgement pending appeal proceedings and conclusion.
   The Company, based on external opinion and legal assessment, believes that it has a strong case and would defend its position 
vigorously and pursue legal remedies to overturn the adverse judgement of the trial court.
   In October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of 
Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to and download of their confidential information 
and use thereof in the development of the Company’s product MedMantra. Pursuant to unfavourable judgment from 
the District Court and Appeals Court which awarded US $140 million as compensatory damages and US $140 million 
as punitive damages, Epic invoked payment of US $140 million out of US $440 million Letter of Credit provided as 
security, towards compensatory damages in April 2022. The Company’s petition to the Supreme Court to review the 
entire judgement including both the compensatory and punitive damages re-affirmed by the Appeals Court was rejected 
by the Supreme Court on November 20, 2023, pursuant to which, punitive damages of US $140 million was paid on 
December 1, 2023. The Company provided the balance punitive damages amount of US $115 million (equivalent to 
`958 crore) in its financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and disclosed the same as an “exceptional item” 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
 • Letter of comfort
  The Company has given letter of comfort to banks for credit facilities availed by its subsidiaries. As per the terms of letter of 
comfort, the Company undertakes not to divest its ownership interest directly or indirectly in the subsidiary and provide such 
managerial, technical and financial assistance to ensure continued successful operations of the subsidiary.
 The amounts assessed as contingent liability do not include interest that could be claimed by counter parties.

1. TCS Financial Solutions (Beijing) Co., Ltd. merged with Tata Consultancy Services (China) Co. Ltd. w.e.f. July 1, 2024.
2. On December 20, 2024, Tata Consultancy Services (Africa) (Proprietary) Limited (TCS Africa), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Tata Consultancy Services 
(South Africa) (Proprietary) Limited (TCS SA), a step down wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into an agreement with Isisekelo Sethu Trust (Trust) to sell 
and dispose off 30% of shares held by TCS Africa in TCS SA to comply with the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) guidelines in South Africa. Accordingly, 
30% of shares held by TCS Africa in TCS SA were sold to the Trust for a consideration of ZAR 61 million (equivalent to `28 crore) on December 20, 2024. Consequent to the 
above transaction, TCS SA ceased to be a wholly owned step-down subsidiary of TCS. The Trust is a registered trust in South Africa which is formed for the purpose of, inter

3. On January 29, 2025, the Share Purchase and Securities Purchase Agreement (SSPA) has been executed between Tata Consultancy 
Services Limited (Company), Tata Realty and Infrastructure Limited (TRIL), TRIL Bengaluru Real Estate Five Limited (TBRF) and TRIL 
Bengaluru Real Estate Six Limited (TBRS) for acquisition of 100% equity shares and optionally redeemable convertible debentures of 
TBRF and TBRS held by TRIL, in two tranches at a consideration of `1,593 crore. The acquisition of TBRF and TBRS does not meet the 
definition of ‘business’ in accordance with Ind AS - 103 Business Combinations and is treated as acquisition of assets. The fair value of 
freehold land as determined by independent valuation is `1,600 crore. The fair value of capital work-in-progress is `25 crore, inter-
corporate deposits is `27 crore and the balance is towards the other assets and liabilities taken over . Based on the terms of the SSPA, 
on January 29, 2025 the Company paid `1,036 crore and recognised a financial liability of  `557 crore (towards consideration payable 
at a future date for 35% stake) to acquire the entire stake in equity shares and optionally redeemable convertible debentures in TBRF 
and TBRS. Consequently, TBRF and TBRS have become wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company from that date.

Standalone Financial Statements 
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of  
Tata Consultancy Services Limited  
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion 
We have audited the standalone financial statements of Tata 
Consultancy Services Limited (the “Company”) which comprise 
the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the 
standalone statement of profit and loss (including other 
comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in 
equity and standalone statement of cash flows for the year 
then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, 
including material accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and 
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 
31 March 2025, and its profit and other comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that 
date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Revenue recognition-Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognised using percentage of completion method
Refer Note 4(a) and 10 to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts, wherein, 
revenue is recognised using the percentage of completion 
computed as per the input method based on the Company’s 
estimate of contract costs.
We identified revenue recognition of fixed price contracts where 
the percentage of completion is used as a key audit matter since -
• there is an inherent risk and presumed fraud risk around the 
accuracy and existence of revenues recognised considering 
the customised and complex nature of these contracts and 
significant inputs of IT systems;
• application of revenue recognition using percentage of 
completion under accounting standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue 
from Contracts with customers) is complex and involves 
estimating the future cost-to-completion of these contracts, 
which is used to measure the stage of completion of the 
relevant performance obligation;
• these contracts may involve onerous obligations which 
requires critical assessment of foreseeable losses to be made 
by the Company; and
• at year-end, significant amount of contract assets, unearned 
and deferred revenue balances related to these contracts are 
recognised on the balance sheet.
Our audit procedures included the following:
• Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and 
controls implemented by the Company for recording and 
computing revenue and the associated contract assets, 
unearned and deferred revenue balances.
• Involved our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as 
required and assessed the IT environment in which the 
business systems operate.
• Evaluated the design and implementation and tested 
operating effectiveness of Company’s key manual and 
automated internal financial controls over:
  Computation of revenue recognition;
  Cost and revenue reports generated by the system;
   Allocation of resources and budgeting systems which 
prevent the unauthorised recording/changes to costs 
incurred; and
   Estimation of contract costs required to complete the 
respective projects.
• On specific and statistically selected samples of contracts, 
we tested that the revenue recognised is in accordance with 
the revenue recognition accounting standard. This includes 
testing the Company’s computation of the estimation of 
contract costs and onerous obligations, if any, where we:
   assessed that the estimates of costs to complete were 
reviewed and approved by appropriate designated 
management personnel;
   performed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred 
with estimated costs to identify significant variations 
and challenged whether those variations are required 
to be considered in estimating the remaining costs to 
complete the contract;
   assessed the appropriateness of contract assets, 
unearned and deferred revenue on balance sheet date 
by evaluating the progress of underlying contracts and 
milestones achieved to identify possible changes in 
estimated costs to complete the remaining performance 
obligations; and
   inspected underlying documents and performed 
substantive procedures over cost budget changes to 
determine reasonableness of contract costs.
• Tested details of a sample of journal entries related to 
revenue recognised from percentage of completion method 
throughout the reporting period, using risk-based criteria, 
with the relevant underlying documentation.
• Assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the 
standalone financial statements.

Other Information
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s annual 
report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s 
report thereon. The Company’s annual report is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
When we read the Company’s annual report, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance and 
take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and 
regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, 
profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 
133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of 
the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board of 
Directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the 
aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of 
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal 
and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even 
date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the 
Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of 
the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year 
ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such internal financial controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements criteria established 
by the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
were established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the standalone financial statements 
of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation 
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements include 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1) Corporate information
 Tata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS 
Limited” or “the Company”) provides IT services, consulting 
and business solutions and has been partnering with many 
of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation 
journeys. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive 
powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and 
engineering services and solutions. This is delivered 
through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery 
model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software 
development.
 The Company is a public limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office 
is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As 
at March 31, 2025, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding 
company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share 
capital.
 The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 
authorised for issue on April 10, 2025.
2) Statement of compliance
 These standalone financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to 
time.
3) Basis of preparation
 These standalone financial statements have been prepared 
on historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured 
at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting 
period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of 
the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and 
non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. 
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers 
and time elapsed between deployment of resources 
and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the 
consideration for such services rendered, the Company has 
considered an operating cycle of 12 months.
 The statement of cash flows has been prepared under 
indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals 
or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and items of income or expense associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from 
operating, investing and financing activities of the Company 
are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value to be cash equivalents.
 These standalone financial statements have been prepared 
in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the 
Company. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing 
on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses 
arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
foreign currencies are not retranslated.
 The material accounting policy information related to 
preparation of the standalone financial statements have 
been discussed in the respective notes.
4) Use of estimates and judgements 
 The preparation of standalone financial statements 
in conformity with the recognition and measurement 
principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company 
to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported 
balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent 
liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements 
and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the 
periods presented.
 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised 
and future periods are affected.
 The Company uses the following critical accounting 
judgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of 
its standalone financial statements:
 (a) Revenue recognition
  Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using 
percentage-of-completion method. The Company 
estimates the future cost-to-completion of the 
contracts which is used to determine degree of 
completion of the performance obligation.
  The Company exercises judgement for identification of 
performance obligations, determination of transaction 
price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation and in determining whether 
the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in 
time or over a period of time. These judgements 
have been explained in detail under the revenue 
recognition note (Refer note 10).
 (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
  The Company reviews the useful life of property, 
plant and equipment at the end of each reporting 
period. This reassessment may result in change in 
depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 
8(a)).
 (c) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
  The Company reviews its carrying value of investments 
carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, 
or more frequently when there is indication for


## Page 260

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
Standalone Financial Statements 2024-25
257
impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its 
carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for 
in the statement of profit and loss.
 (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments
  When the fair value of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs 
to these models are taken from observable markets 
where possible, but where this is not feasible, a 
degree of judgement is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes 
in assumptions about these factors could affect the 
reported fair value of financial instruments.
 (e)  Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair 
value)
  Measurement of impairment of financial assets 
require use of estimates, which have been explained 
in the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and 
equity instruments, under impairment of financial 
assets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 6).
 (f) Deferred tax assets
  A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, 
the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the 
carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of 
each reporting period.
 (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities
  The Company estimates the provisions that have 
present obligations as a result of past events and it is 
probable that outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates. 
  The Company uses significant judgements to assess 
contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are 
disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising 
from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company or a present 
obligation that arises from past events where it is 
either not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable 
estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent 
assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the 
standalone financial statements.
 (h) Employee benefits
  The accounting of employee benefit plans in the 
nature of defined benefit requires the Company to use 
assumptions. These assumptions have been explained 
under employee benefits note (Refer note 12).
 (i) Leases
  The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. 
The Company uses significant judgement in assessing 
the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and 
the applicable discount rate. 
  The Company determines the lease term as the 
non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both 
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if 
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option; and periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not 
to exercise that option. In assessing whether the 
Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option 
to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to 
terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances that create an economic incentive for 
the Company to exercise the option to extend the 
lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the 
lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a 
change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.
  The discount rate is generally based on the 
incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being 
evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics.
5) Recent pronouncements
 Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued 
from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2025, 
MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance Contracts and 
amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, relating to sale 
and leaseback transactions, applicable to the Company 
w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Company has reviewed the 
new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has 
determined that it does not have any significant impact in 
its financial statements.
6)  Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity 
instruments
 Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which 
are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair 
value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or 
financial liability.
 The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire,


## Page 261

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
Standalone Financial Statements 2024-25
 258
or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another 
entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, 
and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or have expired.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash 
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances 
with banks and which are unrestricted for withdrawal and 
usage.
 Financial assets at amortised cost
 Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost if these financial assets are held within a business 
whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
  Financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income
 Financial assets are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
 The Company has made an irrevocable election to present 
subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments 
not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit 
or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in 
statement of profit and loss.
 Investment in subsidiaries
 Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less 
impairment loss, if any.
 Financial liabilities
 Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
 Equity instruments
 An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual 
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all 
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company 
are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue 
cost.
 Derivative accounting
 • Instruments in hedging relationship
  The Company designates certain foreign exchange 
forward, currency options and futures contracts as 
hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange 
risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges.
  The Company uses hedging instruments that are 
governed by the financial risk management policy as 
approved by the Risk Management Committee. The 
policy provides principles on the use of such financial 
derivatives consistent with the risk management 
strategy of the Company. While determining the 
appropriate hedge ratio, the Company takes into 
consideration the prevailing macro-economic 
conditions, the availability and liquidity of the hedging 
instruments, tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness 
and the costs of hedging. The hedging activities are 
reviewed by the Risk Management Committee every 
quarter and future course of action is determined.
  The hedge instruments are designated and 
documented as hedges at the inception of the 
contract. The Company determines the existence 
of an economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item based on the currency, 
amount and timing of their respective cash flows. 
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce 
the risk associated with the exposure being hedged 
is assessed and measured at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no 
longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have 
been accumulated in other equity are immediately 
reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the 
statement of profit and loss. 
  The effective portion of change in the fair value of the 
designated hedging instrument is recognised in the 
other comprehensive income and accumulated under 
the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
  The Company separates the intrinsic value and 
time value of an option and designates as hedging 
instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the 
option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value 
and time value of an option is recognised in the other 
comprehensive income and accounted as a separate 
component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified 
into the statement of profit and loss when the related 
hedged items affect profit and loss.
  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or 
loss recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity till that time remains and is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss when 
the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and 
loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes 
ineffective.

 • Instruments not in hedging relationship
  The Company enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge 
accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
 Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)
 The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 
109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses 
for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowance 
for expected credit losses, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade 
receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for 
forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance 
rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 
12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset 
has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Notes:
1. On January 29, 2025, the Share Purchase and Securities Purchase Agreement (SSPA) has been executed between Tata Consultancy 
Services Limited (Company), Tata Realty and Infrastructure Limited (TRIL), TRIL Bengaluru Real Estate Five Limited (TBRF) and TRIL 
Bengaluru Real Estate Six Limited (TBRS) for acquisition of 100% equity shares and optionally redeemable convertible debentures of 
TBRF and TBRS held by TRIL, in two tranches at a consideration of `1,593 crore.
 Based on the terms of the SSPA, on January 29, 2025 the Company paid `1,036 crore and recognised a financial liability of `557 crore 
(towards consideration payable at a future date for 35% stake) to acquire the entire stake in equity shares and optionally redeemable 
convertible debentures in TBRF and TBRS. Consequently, TBRF and TBRS have become wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company 
from that date.

 Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, approximate the fair 
value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities 
which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value 
measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is NIL and `940 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 
2024 respectively.
(k) Fair value hierarchy 
 The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or 
unobservable and consists of the following three levels: 
 • Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 •  Level 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
 •  Level 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in 
part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market 
transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
 The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide 
range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.
 The following table summarises financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and financial assets that are 
not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (but fair value disclosures are required):

(l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity
 The Company’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs 
are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations. 
 The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk 
management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the 
guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Company uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, 
currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.
 The following are outstanding currency options contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges:

 The Company has entered into derivative instruments not in hedging relationship by way of foreign exchange forward, currency 
options and futures contracts. As at March 31, 2025 and 2024, the notional amount of outstanding contracts aggregated to 
`51,859 crore and `49,180 crore, respectively, and the respective fair value of these contracts have a net gain of `211 crore and net 
loss of `42 crore.
 Exchange loss of `316 crore and gain of `30 crore on foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting have been recognised in the standalone statement of profit and loss for the years ended 
March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
 Net foreign exchange gain / (loss) include loss of `41 crore and `102 crore transferred from cash flow hedging reserve for the years 
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
 Net loss on derivative instruments of `15 crore recognised in cash flow hedging reserve as at March 31, 2025, is expected to be 
transferred to the statement of profit and loss by March 31, 2026. The maximum period over which the exposure to cash flow 
variability has been hedged is through calendar year 2025.

(m) Financial risk management
 The Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which 
may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks 
associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the 
risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects 
on the financial performance of the Company.
 Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest 
rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency 
exchange rate risk.
 • Foreign currency exchange rate risk
  The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities 
are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. Considering the countries and economic 
environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in 
those countries. 
  The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any 
movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the 
Company’s revenue in international business.
  The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It 
hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.
  The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous 
parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.
  The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet which 
could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated 
below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).
  The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2025:
(` crore)
USD EUR GBP Others
Net financial assets  7,508  533  526  2,327 
Net financial liabilities  (10,726)  (350)  (376)  (862)
  10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the Company with respect to various foreign currencies 
would result in increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately `142 crore for the year ended 
March 31, 2025.

Net financial liabilities  (11,238)  (760)  (2,215)  (1,530)
  10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the Company with respect to various foreign currencies 
would result in increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately `847 crore for the year ended 
March 31, 2024.
 • Interest rate risk
  The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Company is not significantly 
exposed to interest rate risk.
 Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms 
or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well 
as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous 
basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 4 for methods, assumptions 
and information used to measure expected credit losses.
 Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial 
instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Loans include Inter-corporate deposits of 
`36 crore placed with two subsidiaries as at March 31, 2025 and NIL as at March 31, 2024, respectively. Bank deposits include 
an amount of `3,692 crore held with two banks and `2,500 crore held with two banks, having high credit rating which are 
individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. None of 
the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.
 • Exposure to credit risk 
  The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk was `96,535 crore and `90,407 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, being the total of 
the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference investments, trade 
receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets.
  The Company’s exposure to customers is diversified. As at March 31, 2025, a single customer held more than 10% of the 
outstanding of trade receivables and contract assets at 10.28%. As at March 31, 2024, no single customer held more than 
10% of outstanding of trade receivables and contract assets.
 • Geographic concentration of credit risk
  Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:
As at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024
Gross% Net% Gross% Net%
United States of America  45.08  45.80  52.31  53.20 
India  21.98  20.68  13.22  11.68 
United Kingdom  15.62  15.88  16.47  16.78 
  Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the 
location of the customers.

7) Leases
 A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.
 Company as a lessee
 The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the 
contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the 
lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components. 
 The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease 
commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and 
removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently 
measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of 
the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter 
of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis 
as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
 The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date 
of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. 
If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar 
characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the 
incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, 
residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and 
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. 
The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing 
the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease 
modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement 
of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the 
nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the 
measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and 
loss.
 The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases 
are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 Company as a lessor
 At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company 
recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In case of a 
finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on 
the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease 
and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from 
the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company applies the 
exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.
 If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with 
customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

 Interest on lease liabilities is `556 crore and `438 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
 The Company incurred `199 crore and `221 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, towards expenses 
relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
 The total cash outflow for leases is `1,961 crore and `1,737 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, 
including cash outflow for short term leases and leases of low-value assets.
 The Company has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. The present value of 
future cash outflows for such extension periods is `943 crore and `815 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
 Lease contracts entered by the Company majorly pertain for buildings taken on lease to conduct its business in the ordinary course.
 The Company does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract.
8) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities 
(a) Property, plant and equipment
 The Company recognises the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can measured reliably. 
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the 
asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if 
any.
 Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over 
their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories of assets, 
where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
 The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below:
Type of asset Useful lives
Buildings 20 years*
Leasehold improvements Lease term
Plant and equipment 10 years*
Computer equipment 4 years*
Vehicles 4 years*
Office equipment 2-5 years*
Electrical installations 4-10 years*
Furniture and fixtures 5 years*
 *The Company believes that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best 
represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.
 Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its 
intended use.
 Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to 
sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to 
which the asset belongs.
 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or 
CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 
 The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal.

(b) Intangible assets
 Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment, if any.
 Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences which are amortised over licence period which 
equates the economic useful life ranging between 1-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life.
 Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may 
not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-
in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs.
 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or 
CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

10) Revenue recognition
 The Company earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Company offers a 
consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. 
 Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
 • Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, 
number of transactions processed, etc.

 • Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide 
services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance. 
 • In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of 
accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract 
costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  
 • Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is 
recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation 
and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are 
accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
 • Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the 
customer. 
 • The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for 
supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the 
principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is 
acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.
 Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, 
performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes 
taxes collected from customers.
 The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The 
Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to 
benefit independently from such deliverables.
 Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration 
with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The 
transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. 
Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service 
from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is 
highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end 
of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the 
contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.
 The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period 
of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the 
asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or 
service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
 Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.
 Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for 
capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this 
criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to 
satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.
 Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as 
unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is 
required, as per contractual terms. 
 Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
 The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress 
payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

 In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received. 
 Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews 
modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new 
performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is 
revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
 The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.
 Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

 Information about major customers
 No single customer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
 While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) 
performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Company has 
applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated 
to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to 
the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.

 Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, 
changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The 
aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,55,554 crore out of 
which 46.47% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter . No consideration from contracts 
with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

12) Employee benefits
 Defined benefit plans
 For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with 
a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and 
unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity 
recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
 The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available 
refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
 The Company provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are 
treated as defined benefit plans.
 Defined contribution plans
 Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to 
such benefits.
 The Company provides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are treated as 
defined contribution plans.

 Short-term employee benefits
 All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. 
Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders 
the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
 Compensated absences
 Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee 
renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are 
not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are 
recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

 The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plan are set out below:
As at March 31, 2025 As at March 31, 2024
Domestic plans Foreign plans Domestic plans Foreign plans
Discount rate 6.50% 3.30%-4.50% 7.25% 3.50%-4.80%

Rate of return on plan assets 6.50% 3.30%-4.50% 7.25% 3.50%-4.80%
Weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations 6 Years 3-6 Years 6 Years 3-6 Years
 Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of 
India.
 The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit plan obligations 
as at March 31, 2025. The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan obligations funds for year ending 
March 31, 2026 in view of adequate surplus plan assets as at March 31, 2025.
 The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary 
increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions 
occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
 If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:
(` crore)
As at  
March 31, 2025
As at  
March 31, 2024
Increase of 0.50%  (155)  (123)
Decrease of 0.50%  163  129 
 If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:
(` crore)
As at  
March 31, 2025
As at  
March 31, 2024
Increase of 0.50%  163  130 
Decrease of 0.50%  (156)  (125)
 The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

 Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the 
defined benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet.
 Each year an Asset - Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed 
in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.
 The defined benefit obligations shall mature after the year ended March 31, 2025 as follows:

 Provident fund
 In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident 
fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company 
to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company 
is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government 
administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to the Government administered pension fund. 
The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in statement of profit and 
loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance 
issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as 
the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual 
members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.
 The following table sets out the details of the defined benefit provident fund plan and the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements:

15) Income taxes
 Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year . Current 
and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
 Current income taxes
 The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company in India and in its branches in overseas where it 
operates.
 The Company has recognised income tax expenses applying the provisions under section 115BAA of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
 Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the 
jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax 
liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
 Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations 
are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
 Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and 
income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability 
on a net basis.
 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published the model rules for global minimum tax (Pillar 
Two model rules). Pillar Two legislation has been enacted, or substantively enacted, in certain jurisdictions where the Company 
operates. The Company is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules and has evaluated the potential exposure to global 
minimum tax. The Company does not expect any material financial impact for the current period. The evaluation of the potential 
exposure is based on the most recent country-by-country reporting, and financial statements for the constituent entities in the 
Company.
 Deferred income taxes
 Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised 
for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, 
except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
 Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
 The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the 
years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant 
entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and environmental and social 
professionals.
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention to cause us to believe that the 
Company’s Identified Sustainability Information in pages 18 to 29, 127 to 164, and 319 to 325 of the Integrated Annual Report 
relating to select GRI and BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) for the year ended 31 March 2025, is not prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the World Resource Institute (WRI) / World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and Reporting  Standards), and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 
3) Accounting & Reporting Standard, Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and with reference to the GRI Standards (2021) as per Reporting boundary set out in page no: 
128 in BRSR section of the  Integrated Annual Report.
Basis for conclusion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), 
Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on 
Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants 
(IESBA).

KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP (‘the firm’) applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality 
Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, 
issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Other information
The Company’s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Company’s Integrated Annual Report (but does not include the select BRSR and GRI attributes and 
assurance report thereon). 
Additionally, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on BRSR Core attributes and issued an independent assurance 
report on 27 May 2025. Our report thereon is included with the other information.
Our limited assurance conclusion on the select BRSR and GRI attributes does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our assurance report of the select BRSR and GRI attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information and, 
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the select BRSR and GRI attributes, our knowledge 
obtained in the assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other 
information that we obtained prior to the date of this reasonable assurance report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Intended use or purpose
The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR and GRI attributes, 
the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is 
prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter .
Management’s responsibilities for Identified Sustainability Information (ISI)
The management of the Company are responsible for: 
• designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information 
that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; 
• selecting or developing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability Information and appropriately referring to or 
describing the criteria; and
• preparing, fairly stating and properly calculating the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the reporting criteria.
• ensuring the reporting criteria is available for the intended users with relevant explanation;
• establishing targets, goals and other performance measures, and implementing actions to achieve such targets, goals and 
performance measures;
• providing the details of the management personnel who takes ownership of the ISI disclosed in the report;
• ensuring compliance with law, regulation or applicable contracts;
• making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; 
• identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the measurement or evaluation of ISI covered by assurance in accordance 
with the reporting criteria; 
• preventing and detecting fraud;
• selecting the content of the ISI, including identifying and engaging with intended users to understand their information needs;
• informing us of other information that will be included with the ISI;
• supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of the ISI


## Page 331

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
Sustainability Disclosures
 328
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations
The preparation of the Company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make 
determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
information.
Measurement of certain amounts with respect to BRSR and GRI attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial 
inherent measurement uncertainty, for example GHG footprint, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate 
evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. 
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
• planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error; 
• forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and 
• reporting our conclusion to the Board of Directors of TCS. 
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and 
performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for limited assurance conclusion. 
Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the ISI covered by limited assurance and other engagement 
circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. In carrying out our engagement, we:
• assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by limited assurance; 
• interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning policies for occupational health 
and safety, and the implementation of these across the business;
• through inquiries, obtained an understanding of TCS’s control environment, processes and information systems relevant to 
the preparation of the ISI  covered by limited assurance, but did not evaluate the design of particular control activities, obtain 
evidence about their implementation or test their operating effectiveness;
• made inquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of the ISI  covered by limited 
assurance;
• applied analytical procedures, as appropriate; 
• recalculated the ISI covered by limited assurance based on the criteria; and
• evaluated the overall presentation of the ISI covered by limited assurance to determine whether it is consistent with the criteria 
and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the Company.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a 
reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially 
lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. 
Exclusions:
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:
• Any form of review of the commercial merits, technical feasibility, accuracy, compliance with applicable legislation for the project, 
and accordingly we will express no opinion thereon. We will also not be required to verify any of the judgments and commercial 
risks associated with the project, nor comment upon the possibility of the financial projections being achieved. The Company’s 
statements that describe the strategy, progress on goals (other than those listed under the scope of assurance), expression 
of opinion, claims, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim to future intention provided by the Company, and assertions related to 
Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.

TCS Safe Harbor Clause
Certain statements in this release concerning our future prospects are forward-looking 
statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from market expectations. 
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to manage 
growth, intense competition among global IT services companies, various factors which 
may affect our profitability, such as wage increases or an appreciating Rupee, our ability 
to attract and retain highly skilled professionals, time and cost overruns on fixed-price, 
fixed-time frame contracts, client concentration, restrictions on cross-border movement 
of skilled personnel, our ability to manage our international operations, reduced demand 
for technology in our key focus areas, disruptions in telecommunication networks, our 
ability to successfully complete and integrate potential acquisitions, liability for damages 
on our service contracts, the success of the companies in which TCS has made strategic 
investments, withdrawal of governmental fiscal incentives, political instability, legal 
restrictions on raising capital or acquiring companies outside India, unauthorized use of 
our intellectual property, cyber attacks or security breaches, pandemics, natural disasters 
and general economic conditions affecting our industry. TCS may, from time to time, 
make additional written and oral forward-looking statements, including our reports to
